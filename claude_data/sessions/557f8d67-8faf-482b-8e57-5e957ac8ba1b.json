Skills Spawning Agent Instances\nWe have a small number of skills, each of which spawns an instance of that agent:\n1. **Task** - General agentic task execution\n2. **Oracle** - (requires changing from custom agent to skill)\n3. **Update and archive** - Documentation refresh and porcelain state\n4. **Improver agent** - (requires changing from custom agent to skill)\n5. **Self improve** - Recursive self-improvement through archive analysis\n\n### 3. MCP Tools in 1-1 Correspondence\nWe have a custom MCP with tools in 1-1 correspondence with those skills, each of which orchestrates a general purpose agent whose objective is to complete the assigned skill. The orchestration uses our custom state tracking system to give the newly spawned agent highly efficient situational awareness, and helps couple it to our archival system.\n\n### 4. Gated Workflows\nThe MCP tool call/skill follow a well-prescribed workflow with gates. Every gate must use our custom testing infrastructure to determine if things can proceed or not.
