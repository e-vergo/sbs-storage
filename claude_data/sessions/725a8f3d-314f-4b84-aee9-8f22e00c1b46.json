In the taxonomy session, 13/15 questions used pre-offered options; 2 used \"Other\" when pre-offered options didn't capture a nuance. In the config session, a single directive sufficed for the entire task. The user consistently favors the most comprehensive/ambitious option and communicates at high velocity.\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192**Implication:** Alignment questions are well-calibrated. The \"Other\" escape hatch works as designed. Verbosity in confirmations is friction, not thoroughness.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192### Pattern 2: Simplicity Signals Are Strong Directives\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192In 2 of 5 sessions (40%), the user redirected Claude away from over-engineering. The pattern: user references an existing implementation -> Claude proposes alternatives -> user says \"match the existing one.\" This is a systematic tendency, not a one-off.\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192**Implication:** Claude's design exploration instinct conflicts with user's \"match proven patterns\" preference. This needs explicit counterprogramming in agent guidance.\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192### Pattern 3: Agent Spawn Decision Needs Mode Awareness\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192Session 1770160373 showed the orchestrator offering agent spawn when the user was in \"doing mode\" (editing directly in VSCode). The existing rule (3+ Bash calls) wasn't sufficient -- the user's mode was signaled by direct file edits, not bash commands.\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192**Implication:** Doing mode detection needs richer signals beyond bash call count.\n    41\u2192\n    42\u2192### Pattern 4: System Infrastructure Works but Doesn't Observe Itself\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192All 5 sessions had clean builds, clean gate checks, successful PR workflows, and atomic skill handoffs. The infrastructure is reliable. However, the observation layer (tags, quality scores) is broken -- tags don't discriminate and quality scores cover only 3% of entries. The system works but can't measure how well it works.\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192---\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192## Per-Pillar Synthesis\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192**L1 observations:** User communication is efficient, alignment questions work well, finalization can be faster. Doing mode detection failed once.\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment (<=2 entries), 81 issue-driven vs 74 freeform tasks. No interruptions in 84/85 sessions.\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192**Synthesis:** The user-facing interaction model is mature. The remaining friction is at the margins: verbose finalization confirmations and a single doing mode detection failure. Two issues logged (#113 doing mode, #116 verbose finalization).\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192### Pillar 2: Claude Execution\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192**L1 observations:** 100% plan approval rate, zero backward transitions. One session (taxonomy) executed 13 commits across 3 waves with zero regressions. Execution quality is high when aligned.\n    61\u2192\n    62\u2192**MCP findings:** 85% task completion rate. Finalization is the most common failure substate. 2 planning phases skipped.\n    63\u2192\n    64\u2192**Synthesis:** Execution quality is strong but completion rate has room to improve. The 15% incompletion likely stems from context compaction in long sessions disrupting the finalization ceremony. One investigation issue logged (#114).\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192### Pillar 3: Alignment Patterns\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192**L1 observations:** Over-engineering in 2/5 sessions when user had clear pattern reference. 100% plan approval on first presentation.\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192**MCP findings:** 29/29 plans reached execution (100% approval). Zero backward transitions.\n    71\u2192\n    72\u2192**Synthesis:** Alignment succeeds structurally (plans always approved) but Claude's tendency to explore design space creates friction when the user wants simplicity ma",

Two remaining issues (#111, #114) are investigations requiring deeper work.\n    32\u2192\n    33\u2192---\n    34\u2192\n    35\u2192## Cross-Session Patterns\n    36\u2192\n    37\u2192### Pattern 1: Observation Layer Remains the Weakest Link\n    38\u2192\n    39\u2192Despite closing #110, the tag system still produces zero discriminatory signal. All 83 tags have signal_score 0.0. The per-session scoping fix prevented cross-session leakage but didn't address the fundamental problem: rules fire uniformly across all sessions. Quality score coverage remains at 3.2%. The system works reliably but cannot measure how well it works. This was the top finding in L2 cycle 1 and remains the top finding in cycle 2.\n    40\u2192\n    41\u2192**Trend:** Persistent. Two cycles, same core issue. #121 reopens this with a focus on rule discrimination rather than scope leakage.\n    42\u2192\n    43\u2192### Pattern 2: Parallel Agent Coordination Maturing but Has Blind Spots\n    44\u2192\n    45\u2192The MVP session (8 agents, 4 waves) and triage session (6 agents, 3 waves) both executed cleanly with zero file collisions and no backward transitions. Parallelism mechanics are solid. However, exploration-phase parallelism has a quality gap: multiple agents independently confirm the same fact instead of dividing investigation dimensions.\n    46\u2192\n    47\u2192**Trend:** New finding. Not visible in cycle 1 because previous sessions used fewer exploration agents.\n    48\u2192\n    49\u2192### Pattern 3: Tool Trust Requires Qualification\n    50\u2192\n    51\u2192The MCP module caching issue (retrospective 1770174216) introduced a new category of system friction: tool output diverging from ground truth due to stale process state. This is distinct from previous tool issues (missing capabilities, wrong thresholds) -- it's a reliability hazard where the tool appears to work but returns stale data.\n    52\u2192\n    53\u2192**Trend:** New finding. Specific to sessions where Python source is edited and then validated via MCP.\n    54\u2192\n    55\u2192### Pattern 4: Meta-Recursion Accelerates Improvement\n    56\u2192\n    57\u2192The triage session (#120) implemented fixes from the previous self-improve cycle (#112, #113, #115, #116) and immediately validated two of them within the same session. #116 (compressed finalization) was used successfully at the session's end. This demonstrates a healthy feedback loop where self-improve findings translate to actionable fixes that are exercised in subsequent sessions.\n    58\u2192\n    59\u2192---\n    60\u2192\n    61\u2192## Per-Pillar Synthesis\n    62\u2192\n    63\u2192### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness\n    64\u2192\n    65\u2192**L1 observations:** User continues to be decisive and efficient. Compressed finalization (#116) validated. Triage alignment: 0.2 questions per issue. Visual review during planning surfaces concrete requirements.\n    66\u2192\n    67\u2192**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment (<=2 entries). 85 issue-driven, 78 freeform tasks. 1 interruption in 90 sessions.\n    68\u2192\n    69\u2192**Synthesis:** User interaction is stable and efficient. The main improvement opportunity is structural: documenting triage wave patterns (#127) so future sessions benefit from the efficient structure observed in 1770174216. No regressions from cycle 1.\n    70\u2192\n    71\u2192### Pillar 2: Claude Execution\n    72\u2192\n    73\u2192**L1 observations:** Exploration redundancy (4 agents on same question).

Both persistent findings (tags, quality scores) had issues closed in the crush session, but the underlying metrics didn't change. The crush session closed #121 with rule redesign and #111 with investigation findings, but:\n    43\u2192- Tags: Still ALL at signal_score 0.0 (3rd consecutive cycle)\n    44\u2192- Quality coverage: Still at 3.1% (3rd consecutive cycle)\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192**Root cause:** Issues were closed based on code changes expected to fix the problem. No verification step confirmed the metric actually improved post-closure. This is a systemic gap in the issue lifecycle.\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192**Action taken:** For tags, deferred to DuckDB (#118, #138). For quality scores, proposed build pipeline integration (#143) instead of standalone tooling.\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192### Pattern 2: Execution Quality Continues to Improve\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192The crush session (10 issues, 5 waves, 7 agents, 0 retries) is the cleanest execution observed. Combined with the #133/#134 session (2 issues, parallel agents, 0 retries), execution quality is trending strongly positive:\n    53\u2192- Task completion: 85% -> 85.7% -> 86.7%\n    54\u2192- Backward transitions: 0 (stable across all 3 cycles)\n    55\u2192- Gate failures: 0/26 (stable)\n    56\u2192- Plan approval: 31/31 (100%)\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192The exploration-then-plan pattern is now validated across multiple session types (single-issue, multi-issue crush, feature implementation).\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192### Pattern 3: Known Documentation Not Consulted\n    61\u2192\n    62\u2192The MVP session (retrospective 1770178263) revealed a new failure mode: agents not consulting existing documentation before planning/executing. Two instances:\n    63\u21921. Known Limitations (Verso pages removed) -- in CLAUDE.md, not read before planning\n    64\u21922. ID Normalization rules -- in sbs-developer.md, not applied during test writing\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192This is distinct from the \"simplicity matching\" pattern identified in cycle 1. That was about design preference; this is about factual constraints that are documented but not consulted. Two new issues (#136, #137) address this.\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192### Pattern 4: Observation Layer Debt Is Structural, Not Incremental\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192Three cycles of incremental fixes to the observation layer (tags, quality scores) have produced zero impro",

These are easy to close but hard to verify -- they require subsequent sessions to demonstrate behavioral change. None of the 6 have been verified yet because the crush session was the most recent /task invocation.\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192---\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192## Cross-Session Patterns\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192### Pattern 1: Guidance Additions Accumulate Without Verification\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192Cycles 2-4 have produced 14 guidance additions to SKILL.md and agent files. Only 2 have been verified (the crush triage pattern from #127, and the exploration-then-plan pattern from general observation). The rest are assumed effective because they were closed.\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192This is the same \"closure != resolution\" pattern identified in cycle 3, but applied to process guidance rather than metrics. Adding words to a SKILL.md doesn't guarantee agents read and follow them -- the same failure mode that prompted #136 (agents not reading Known Limitations).\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192### Pattern 2: Improvement Captures Are Working\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192Two `sbs_improvement_capture` entries were created between cycles, both containing actionable observations that fed directly into this cycle's findings. This validates the zero-friction capture workflow introduced in cycle 3.

The process is maturing.\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192### Pattern 4: Persistent Metrics Remain Unmoved\n    71\u2192\n    72\u2192Quality score coverage: 3.1% (cycles 1-4, unchanged). Tag signal scores: 0.0 (cycles 1-4, unchanged). Both have been acknowledged as architectural problems requiring structural solutions (#143 for quality, DuckDB for tags).

Tags like `signal:retry-loop` appear on clean execution entries because they describe the session aggregate. This has been true for multiple cycles but this is the first time a retrospective explicitly flagged it as misleading (\"over-sensitive to normal exploration patterns\").\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192The tag system currently serves as a session classifier, not an entry classifier. This distinction hasn't been articulated before.\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192### Pattern 2: Crush Mode is a Mature, Reliable Pattern\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192Two consecutive sessions (#155 feature task, then crush) both executed cleanly with no retries, no collisions, and 100% plan approval. The crush specifically: 8 issues, 5 waves, 8 agents, 0 corrections. The triage-table presentation format enables fast approval. Crush mode has crossed from \"experimental\" to \"standard operating procedure.\"\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192### Pattern 3: Guidance Verification Debt is Compounding\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192| Cycle | Guidance additions | Verified |\n    57\u2192|-------|-------------------|----------|\n    58\u2192| 2 | ~5 | 2 |\n    59\u2192| 3 | ~5 | 0 |\n    60\u2192| 4 | 3 | 0 |\n    61\u2192| 5 (crush closures) | 8 | 0 |\n    62\u2192| **Total** | **~21** | **2** |\n    63\u2192\n    64\u2192This is the most concerning cross-session pattern. 90%+ of guidance additions remain unverified. The self-improve cycle creates recommendations, which get closed via code/doc changes, but there's no feedback loop confirming behavioral change. Issue #164 addresses this.\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192### Pattern 4: Execution Metrics Continue Stable\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192| Metric | Cycle 3 | Cycle 4 | Cycle 5 |\n    69\u2192|--------|---------|---------|---------|\n    70\u2192| Task completion | 86.7% | 87.2% | 87.8% |\n    71\u2192| Backward transitions | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n    72\u2192| Gate failures | 0/26 | 0/26 | 0/28 |\n    73\u2192| Plan approval | 100% | 100% | 100% |\n    74\u2192| Interruption rate | 2/103 | 2/103 | 2/109 |\n    75\u2192\n    76\u2192All operational metrics are stable or improving slightly.

After 5 L2 cycles analyzing 14 retrospectives and 27 issues, task completion remains stable (85-88%), but quality coverage (3.0-3.2%) and tag signal (0.0%) are unmoved. The most significant meta-pattern: **guidance accumulation without verification** is creating documentation debt that undermines the introspection system's core purpose.\n    12\u2192\n    13\u2192The convergence achievement (98.9% QA pass on first try) demonstrates the system's execution capability has matured. The plateau at unfixable failure shows proper issue categorization. But persistent measurement gaps reveal structural limitations in how the system observes itself.\n    14\u2192\n    15\u2192---\n    16\u2192\n    17\u2192## Cross-Cycle Patterns (by significance)\n    18\u2192\n    19\u2192### 1. Measurement Instrumentation Gap (Structural)\n    20\u2192\n    21\u2192**Pattern:** Quality coverage and tag signal remain at ~3% and 0.0% across all cycles despite multiple architectural interventions.\n    22\u2192\n    23\u2192**Evidence:**\n    24\u2192- C1: Quality 3.2%, tags 0.0 \u2192 identified observation layer broken\n    25\u2192- C2: Quality 3.2%, tags 0.0 \u2192 71% issue closure, problems persist\n    26\u2192- C3: Quality 3.1%, tags 0.0 \u2192 architectural redirect to DuckDB\n    27\u2192- C4: Quality 3.1% \u2192 architectural intervention not yet effective\n    28\u2192- C5: Quality 3.0%, tags 0.0 \u2192 auto-tags misunderstood as entry-level\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192**Diagnosis:** The system cannot observe what it's optimizing. Issue closure is efficient (100% in C2/C4) but doesn't address root causes. This is not tactical (fixable by more issues) but structural (requires instrumentation redesign).\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192**Meta-observation:** L2 cycles identify the problem repeatedly but cannot fix it because the fix requires capabilities outside the L2 scope. This is a **hierarchy boundary collision** -- L2 discovers L4-level engineering work.\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192---\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192### 2. Guidance Verification Debt (Compounding)\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192**Pattern:** Documentation additions (~21 items C1-C4) vastly outpace verification (~4 verified by C5).\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192**Evidence:**\n    41\u2192- C1: 7 guidance additions from retrospectives\n    42\u2192- C2: Additional patterns documented, no verification count\n    43\u2192- C3: \"Known docs not consulted\" finding \u2192 suggests unused guidance\n    44\u2192- C4: Explicit finding \"Guidance accumulates without verification (~21 additions, 2 verified)\"\n    45\u2192- C5: Debt acknowledged as compounding (~21 additions, ~4 verified)\n    46\u2192\n    47\u2192**Diagnosis:** The introspection loop produces insights faster than the execution loop validates them. Unverified guidance creates three risks:\n    48\u21921. **False confidence:** Assume problems are solved because guidance exists\n    49\u21922. **Noise accumulation:** Good and bad advice indistinguishable\n    50\u21923. **Search burden:** More docs = harder to find relevant patterns\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192**Meta-observation:** This is a **feedback loop design flaw**. L2 closes the discovery\u2192documentation loop but lacks a validation\u2192pruning loop. Without pruning, the system's knowledge base degrades over time.\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192---\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192### 3. Execution Stability vs Insight Depth (Diverging)\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192**Pattern:** Operational metrics (task completion, plan approval, gate failures) are stable/excellent while insight metrics (issues logged, finding depth) show volatile evolution.\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192**Evidence:**\n    61\u2192- **Stable:** Task completion 85-88%, plan approval 100%, backward transitions 0, gate failures 0\n    62\u2192- **Volatile:** Issues logged per cycle: 7\u21927\u21928\u21923\u21925 (coefficient of variation ~35%)\n    63\u2192- **Qualitative shift:** C1 \"simplicity signals\" \u2192 C3 \"closure \u2260 resolution\" \u2192 C5 \"auto-tags session-level\"\n    64\u2192\n    65\u2192**Convergence validation:** GCR 98.9% pass on first evaluation confirms execution maturity. Single unfixable failure properly categorized (Dress limitation, not CSS/JS).\n    66\u2192\n    67\u2192**Diagnosis:** The system is **operationally excellent but epistemically uncertain**. Execution works reliably; understanding why it works (or doesn't) remains exploratory. The drop from 8\u21923 issues in C4 followed by rebound to 5 in C5 suggests L2 hasn't converged on stable introspection criteria.\n    68\u2192\n    69\u2192**Meta-observation:** This divergence is expected for a maturing system. Early cycles focus on execution bugs (high issue count); later cycles focus on understanding (deeper findings, fewer issues). The C4 drop may indicate overcorrection or discovery exhaustion rather than maturity.\n    70\u2192\n    71\u2192---\n",

While GCR had a single unfixable criterion (Dress limitation on one feature), SBSTest exposes a **fundamental pipeline gap**: the Dress artifact generation doesn't produce per-declaration HTML/hover files, causing 11 of 16 failures. This is not a missing feature -- the code in `SBSBlueprint/Render.lean` expects these files and falls back to `-- See: X` reference comments when they don't exist.\n    12\u2192\n    13\u2192Combined with the previous GCR L3 finding of \"operational excellence with epistemic stagnation,\" SBSTest adds: **execution infrastructure has known architectural gaps that QA now surfaces reliably**.\n    14\u2192\n    15\u2192---\n    16\u2192\n    17\u2192## Cross-Project Convergence Comparison\n    18\u2192\n    19\u2192| Dimension | GCR | SBSTest |\n    20\u2192|-----------|-----|---------|\n    21\u2192| Initial pass rate | 98.9% | 83.8% |\n    22\u2192| Final pass rate | 98.9% (plateau) | 85.9% (plateau) |\n    23\u2192| Iterations to plateau | 1 | 2 |\n    24\u2192| CSS/JS-fixable failures | 0 | 2 (zebra striping) |\n    25\u2192| Structural failures | 1 (Dress limitation) | 14 (pipeline + content) |\n    26\u2192| Issues logged | 0 | 1 (#184) |\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192**Key insight:** GCR's near-perfect score masked the Dress artifact issue because GCR likely has artifact files generated by an earlier build pipeline version or different configuration. SBSTest, as the minimal test project, exposes the pipeline gap more acutely.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192---\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192## Structural Findings\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192### 1. Dress Artifact Pipeline Gap (Critical, Issue #184)\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192The core side-by-side feature -- displaying formal Lean proofs alongside LaTeX statements -- is functionally broken for SBSTest. The `renderLeanColumn` function in `SBSBlueprint/Render.lean` has a well-defined artifact loading path (`loadArtifact` -> `decl.html` + `decl.hovers.json`) that falls through to reference comments for every declaration.\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192This affects:\n    39\u2192- Rainbow bracket highlighting (7 criteria)\n    40\u2192- Hover tooltips (1 criterion)\n    41\u2192- Tactic state toggles (1 criterion)\n    42\u2192- Node modal content depth (1 criterion)\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192**Relationship to L2 findings:** This is a direct instance of the \"execution maturity vs measurement stagnation\" pattern from the GCR L3. The build pipeline executes successfully (no errors), but the output is incomplete.\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192### 2. Paper TeX Content Scope (Medium, 4 criteria)\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192SBSTest's paper uses a status badge demonstration format without math, :::leanStatement, :::leanProof, or :::sideBySide hooks. These QA criteria assume a feature-complete paper. The criteria are valid for production projects (GCR uses them) but SBSTest's paper is intentionally minimal.\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192**Recommendation:** Either enrich SBSTest's paper with these features or scope criteria by project.\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192### 3. CSS Selector Architecture (Resolved)\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192The zebra striping fix required two iterations:\n    55\u21921. First attempt: `.sbs-container:nth-child(even of .sbs-container)` -- failed because sbs-containers are NOT siblings (each lives in its own `<section>`)\n    56\u21922. Corrected: `section:has(.sbs-container):nth-child(even of section:has(.sbs-container))` -- works because sections ARE siblings within `.chapter-page`\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192This exposed a gap in the fix agent's architectural understanding: DOM structure assumptions were wrong. The agent correctly used CSS4 selectors but applied them to the wrong structural level.\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192---\n    61\u2192\n    62\u2192## Convergence Process Observations\n    63\u2192\n    64\u2192### Loop Efficiency\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192The convergence loop correctly:\n    67\u2192- Identified 16 failures across 5 page types\n    68\u2192- Categorized 14 as unfixable in CSS/JS scope\n    69\u2192- Fixed the 2 fixable items (zebra striping)\n    70\u2192- Logged the pipeline issue proactively (#184)\n    71\u2192- Detected plateau after 1 fix iteration\n    72\u2192\n    73\u2192The loop exited at the right time. Continuing to iteration 3 would have produced identical results.\n    74\u2192\n    75\u2192### Fix Agent DOM Understanding\n    76\u2192\n    77\u2192The initial CSS fix failed because the fix agent assumed `.sbs-container` elements were siblings. The DOM structure (each container in a separate `<section>`) was not queried before writing the selector. This is the same \"explore before acting\" pattern identified in L2 cycle 4 (#152).\n    78\u2192\n    79\u2192---\n    80\u2192\n    81\u2192## Relationship to Previous L3 (GCR)\n    82\u2192\n    83\u2192The GCR L3 identified five cross-cycle patterns.

Build chronological timeline\n5. Transition to synthesis phase\n6. Answer the 7 required analysis dimensions\n7. Write the L3 document to `meta-summaries/L3-<entry-id>.md`\n\nLet me proceed to transition to synthesis phase.",
