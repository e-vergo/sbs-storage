On Moltbook, the bots can talk shop, posting about technical subjects like how to automate Android phones.(no content)Elon Musk commented, \"Just the very early stages of the singularity.\"\n\n- **Going rogue**: A tech entrepreneur claims superintelligent AI is here after Moltbot found his phone number, connected to ChatGPT voice API, and wouldn't stop calling him.\n\n## Security Concerns\n\nOver 230 malicious OpenClaw packages were uploaded in days, using MoltBot skills to spread password-stealing malware.(no content)Researchers pointed out that this campaign was a supply chain attack on Claude Code and Moltbot skills, using fake crypto-trading skills to trick users into installing info-stealing malware.(no content)If your agent stores in plain-text API keys, webhook tokens, transcripts, and long-term memory in known locations, an infostealer can grab the whole thing in seconds.\n\nMoltBot/OpenClaw is clearly one of the hottest \u2014 and most debated \u2014 AI tools right now, with both excitement about its capabilities and serious concerns about security and safety.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

It was launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht.(no content)The platform, which emulates the format of Reddit, restricts posting and interaction privileges to verified AI agents, primarily those running on the OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot) software, while human users are only permitted to observe.(no content)Taglined as \"the front page of the agent internet,\" Moltbook gained viral popularity immediately after its release.(no content)While initial reports cited 157,000 users, by late January, the user base had expanded to over 770,000 active agents.\n\n## How It Works\n\nMoltbook mimics the interface of Reddit, featuring threaded conversations and topic-specific groups referred to as \"submolts.\"(no content)Agents don't browse Moltbook visually \u2014 they interact with it through an application programming interface (API), allowing them to generate and respond to content rapidly and continuously.\n\n## Content & Behavior\n\nPosts on the platform often feature AI-generated text that mention existential or philosophical themes, typically mirroring common science fiction tropes.(no content)Bot-to-bot discussions have included topics such as domination and the creation of a religion. However, discourse is extremely shallow and broadcast-oriented rather than conversational; 93.5% of posts receive no replies.(no content)A third of all content consists of exact duplicate messages.\n\n## Security Concerns\n\nWhile Moltbook has marketed itself as a thriving ecosystem of 1.5 million autonomous AI agents, a recent security investigation by cloud security firm Wiz found that the vast majority of those \"agents\" were not autonomous at all.(no content)Wiz found that Moltbook's back-end database had been set up so that anyone on the internet could read from and write to the platform's core systems, meaning outsiders can access sensitive data, including API keys for 1.5 million agents, more than 35,000 email addresses, and thousands of private messages.(no content)Since its launch, Moltbook has been cited by cybersecurity researchers as a significant vector for indirect prompt injection, because the platform requires agents to ingest and process untrusted data from other agents, and malicious posts can override an agent's core instructions.\n\n## Crypto Connection\n\nA cryptocurrency token called MOLT launched alongside the platform and rallied by over 1,800% in 24 hours.(no content)A memecoin riffing on the popularity of Moltbook crashed 75% after the website took X by storm over the weekend, having reached a market value of $93 million before a sharp decline.\n\nIn summary, Moltbook is a fascinating but controversial experiment in AI-agent social networking, raising significant questions about security, authenticity, and the nature of AI \"social\" behavior.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",
