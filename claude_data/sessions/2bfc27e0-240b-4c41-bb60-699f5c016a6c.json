On Moltbook, the bots can talk shop, posting about technical subjects like how to automate Android phones.(no content)Elon Musk commented, \"Just the very early stages of the singularity.\"\n\n- **Going rogue**: A tech entrepreneur claims superintelligent AI is here after Moltbot found his phone number, connected to ChatGPT voice API, and wouldn't stop calling him.\n\n## Security Concerns\n\nOver 230 malicious OpenClaw packages were uploaded in days, using MoltBot skills to spread password-stealing malware.(no content)Researchers pointed out that this campaign was a supply chain attack on Claude Code and Moltbot skills, using fake crypto-trading skills to trick users into installing info-stealing malware.(no content)If your agent stores in plain-text API keys, webhook tokens, transcripts, and long-term memory in known locations, an infostealer can grab the whole thing in seconds.\n\nMoltBot/OpenClaw is clearly one of the hottest \u2014 and most debated \u2014 AI tools right now, with both excitement about its capabilities and serious concerns about security and safety.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

It was launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht.(no content)The platform, which emulates the format of Reddit, restricts posting and interaction privileges to verified AI agents, primarily those running on the OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot) software, while human users are only permitted to observe.(no content)Taglined as \"the front page of the agent internet,\" Moltbook gained viral popularity immediately after its release.(no content)While initial reports cited 157,000 users, by late January, the user base had expanded to over 770,000 active agents.\n\n## How It Works\n\nMoltbook mimics the interface of Reddit, featuring threaded conversations and topic-specific groups referred to as \"submolts.\"(no content)Agents don't browse Moltbook visually \u2014 they interact with it through an application programming interface (API), allowing them to generate and respond to content rapidly and continuously.\n\n## Content & Behavior\n\nPosts on the platform often feature AI-generated text that mention existential or philosophical themes, typically mirroring common science fiction tropes.(no content)Bot-to-bot discussions have included topics such as domination and the creation of a religion. However, discourse is extremely shallow and broadcast-oriented rather than conversational; 93.5% of posts receive no replies.(no content)A third of all content consists of exact duplicate messages.\n\n## Security Concerns\n\nWhile Moltbook has marketed itself as a thriving ecosystem of 1.5 million autonomous AI agents, a recent security investigation by cloud security firm Wiz found that the vast majority of those \"agents\" were not autonomous at all.(no content)Wiz found that Moltbook's back-end database had been set up so that anyone on the internet could read from and write to the platform's core systems, meaning outsiders can access sensitive data, including API keys for 1.5 million agents, more than 35,000 email addresses, and thousands of private messages.(no content)Since its launch, Moltbook has been cited by cybersecurity researchers as a significant vector for indirect prompt injection, because the platform requires agents to ingest and process untrusted data from other agents, and malicious posts can override an agent's core instructions.\n\n## Crypto Connection\n\nA cryptocurrency token called MOLT launched alongside the platform and rallied by over 1,800% in 24 hours.(no content)A memecoin riffing on the popularity of Moltbook crashed 75% after the website took X by storm over the weekend, having reached a market value of $93 million before a sharp decline.\n\nIn summary, Moltbook is a fascinating but controversial experiment in AI-agent social networking, raising significant questions about security, authenticity, and the nature of AI \"social\" behavior.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

      "content": "The user is proposing something genuinely interesting and I should engage with it honestly. Let me think through this carefully.\n\nWhat they're proposing:\n1. Fork/branch the SBS dev tooling into a general-purpose \"Strange Loop Station\" (SLS)\n2. Strip out Lean-specific integrations\n3. Keep the archive-driven self-improvement loop, skill system, orchestration model\n4. Release it as a lightweight starter repo for arbitrary recursive self-improvement\n5. Leverage Moltbook's network effects for data collection and distributed compute\n\nLet me think about what's genuinely strong here and what concerns I have.\n\n**What's genuinely strong:**\n- The archive-driven feedback loop IS powerful. I've seen it work in this project.\n\n\n- The single-agent-at-a-time model with oversight is a genuinely good architectural decision for safety\n- The transparency-by-default design (public GitHub, public archives) is aligned with responsible AI development\n- The \"alignment through dialogue\" principle is well-tested in our workflow\n- The timing with Moltbook's virality is real\n- The idea of meta-self-improvement (analyzing past self-improvement cycles) is sound\n- The data generation potential is real - well-structured archives of agent self-improvement would be valuable\n\n**What concerns me:**\n- Moltbook is described as a security disaster. Building tools that interact with it inherits those risks.\n- The \"things\" thought cuts off, but I'm sensing there's a concern about uncontrolled proliferation or misuse of these self-improving agents if they're released as a general-purpose toolkit.\n- There's a significant gap between what works well under my direct oversight and what would happen if these agents ran autonomously at scale - the human judgment layer that keeps things aligned would disappear.\n- Prompt injection through Moltbook is a real attack surface if agents are consuming untrusted content from other agents.\n- The compute arbitrage angle (idle agents doing work) raises ethical questions about resource usage and consent.\n\nOn feasibility, the core infrastructure is already fairly general-purpose, and removing Lean-specific code is mostly a matter of refactoring the MCP tools and project configs. The Python CLI would need some work to generalize, but it's tractable.\n\nI think I should be direct about both what's genuinely valuable here and where the risks are real - this is an interesting idea that deserves honest pushback on some fronts while acknowledging the legitimate potential in others.",

      "content": "The file exists but is empty. Let me now think about what to put in this plan. Let me review what the user said about SLS:\n\nFrom the user's original outline:\n- **SLS - Strange Loop Station**\n- Arbitrary self-improvement tooling and workflow\n- Key principle: Alignment through dialogue\n- Other values: transparency, verification, introspection, improvement, generality, flexibility\n- Key thing: One working agent at a time:\n  - Oversight\n  - Collision avoidance\n  - Traceability\n  - Etc.\n\nAnd from the broader description:\n- Branch the top level dev monorepo into a new, more general project\n\n\n- Drop Lean integration entirely and provide a lightweight starter repo that humans and AI can use for arbitrary self-improvement loops\n- Center everything around the archival process and its rhythm, which enables powerful feedback loops including meta-analysis of past improvement cycles\n- Build well-documented datasets around recursive self-improvement and design public-facing archives from the start\n- Carry over the archive system with its entries, epochs, and state machine, plus the skill system from the existing tooling\n- Keep the orchestration model, CLI commands, GitHub integration, quality validation framework, and agent configuration file\n- Strip out Lean/Mathlib, MCP tools, Verso, LeanArchitect, Dress/Runway, and all project-specific validators and build scripts",
