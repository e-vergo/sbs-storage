Archival integrity must be preserved\n2. Validation gates can't be weakened\n3. User experience quality must not degrade\n4. But otherwise everything is negotiable\n\nNow I need to understand:\n1.

The example they gave earlier about running `/introspect N` in the background fits perfectly.\n\nI think we have enough alignment. Let me summarize what I understand and propose the investigation approach:\n\n**Investigation approach:**\n1. **Baseline timing analysis** - quantify current state across all data sources\n2. **Async opportunity identification** - what blocks the user that could run in background\n3. **Redundant work detection** - what gets rebuilt/revalidated unnecessarily\n4. **Quick win prioritization** - rank by impact vs effort\n5. **Concrete proposals** - actionable issues ready to spawn\n\nShould I move to planning or do we need more alignment?",
