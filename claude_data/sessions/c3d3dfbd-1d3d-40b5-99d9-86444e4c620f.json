Timing baseline metrics (current iteration time breakdown)\n2. Top 3-5 optimization opportunities ranked by impact vs effort\n3. Concrete proposals ready to spawn as follow-up issues\n4. Prioritization framework for implementation order\n\n## Execution Plan\n\n### Wave 1: Baseline Timing Analysis (4 parallel agents)\n\n**Agent A: Archive Timing Extraction**\n- Query recent archive entries (last 50-100) for converge skill sessions\n- Extract timing breakdowns from `archive_timing` fields\n- Compute percentiles (p50, p90, p95) for each operation category\n- Output: `archive_timing_analysis.json`\n\n**Agent B: Build Timing Analysis**\n- Analyze build logs from `dev/storage/{project}/build_logs/`\n- Extract Lake build times, artifact generation, screenshot capture\n- Identify projects with slowest builds\n- Detect incremental build effectiveness (cache hits vs full rebuilds)\n- Output: `build_timing_analysis.json`\n\n**Agent C: Session JSONL Analysis**\n- Parse session JSONL files for converge-related sessions\n- Extract API latency patterns (time between tool calls)\n- Analyze agent decision patterns (thinking time, tool call sequences)\n- Quantify context usage (cache read ratios, prompt tokens)\n- Output: `session_timing_analysis.json`\n\n**Agent D: Validator + Git Timing Analysis**\n- Parse validator logs for T1-T8 execution times\n- Extract pytest timing data (test discovery, execution, teardown)\n- Analyze git operation timings from archive entries (porcelain checks, commits, pushes)\n- Quantify iCloud sync overhead\n- Output: `validator_git_timing_analysis.json`\n\n**Validator:** All 4 agents complete successfully with JSON output files\n\n---\n\n### Wave 2: Opportunity Identification (1 agent)\n\n**Agent: Synthesis & Opportunity Analysis**\n- Load all 4 JSON outputs from Wave 1\n- Compute overall baseline: total iteration time, phase breakdown\n- Identify async opportunities:\n  - Operations that block user but could run in background\n  - Operations that could run in parallel\n  - Operations that could be deferred\n- Find redundant work:\n  - Unnecessary rebuilds (unchanged source)\n  - Redundant validations (same inputs)\n  - Repeated analysis (cached results available)\n- Calculate potential impact for each opportunity (time saved)\n- Output: `optimization_opportunities.md` with ranked list\n\n**Validator:** Markdown file contains baseline metrics + ranked opportunities\n\n---\n\n### Wave 3: Prioritization & Proposals (1 agent)\n\n**Agent: Concrete Proposals**\n- Review `optimization_opportunities.md`\n- Select top 3-5 opportunities balancing quick wins vs long-term impact\n- For each opportunity, draft:\n  - Concrete implementation proposal\n  - Estimated impact (time saved, UX improvement)\n  - Implementation complexity (effort estimate)\n  - Dependencies and risks\n  - Ready-to-spawn GitHub issue content\n- Create prioritization framework (decision matrix)\n- Output: `optimization_proposals.md` + draft issue content\n\n**Validator:** Proposals document contains actionable next steps\n\n---\n\n## Gates\n\n```yaml\ngates:\n  tests: none               # Investigation task, no test requirements\n  deliverables:\n    - baseline_metrics: present\n    - ranked_opportunities: 3-5 items minimum\n    - concrete_proposals: actionable and specific\n    - prioritization_framework: defined\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Baseline metrics quantify current state (iteration time breakdown)\n- Top 3-5 opportunities identified with estimated impact\n- Concrete proposals ready to spawn as follow-up issues\n- Prioritization framework enables implementation decisions\n- Quick wins highlighted (async operations, redundant work elimination)\n\n## Constraints\n- Preserve archival integrity (completeness, fidelity)\n- Validation gates cannot be weakened\n- User experience quality must not degrade\n- Creative solutions encouraged within these boundaries\n\n## Affected Components\n- `/converge` skill (primary)\n- `/task` skill (gate validation, phase transitions)\n- `/introspect` skill (async candidate)\n- `/update-and-archive` skill (async candidate)\n- Archive upload system (`dev/scripts/sbs/archive/upload.py`)\n- Build pipeline (`dev/scripts/build.py`)\n- Validator framework (`dev/scripts/sbs/validators/`)\n\n## Notes\n- First optimization effort focused on clock time\n- Many quick wins likely available (low-hanging fruit)\n- User example: running `/introspect N` in background during work\n- Pain point: accumulation of many waits, not single bottleneck\n- Target: 50%+ iteration time reduction + remove user-blocking waits\n"

The example they gave earlier about running `/introspect N` in the background fits perfectly.\n\nI think we have enough alignment. Let me summarize what I understand and propose the investigation approach:\n\n**Investigation approach:**\n1. **Baseline timing analysis** - quantify current state across all data sources\n2. **Async opportunity identification** - what blocks the user that could run in background\n3. **Redundant work detection** - what gets rebuilt/revalidated unnecessarily\n4. **Quick win prioritization** - rank by impact vs effort\n5. **Concrete proposals** - actionable issues ready to spawn\n\nShould I move to planning or do we need more alignment?",
