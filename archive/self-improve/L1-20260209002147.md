## Cross-Session Patterns

### 1. Infrastructure friction dominates this epoch (confirmed by both L0s)

Both L0 findings independently identified that the Feb 8 restructuring session was dominated by infrastructure friction rather than productive work. L0-1 identified 5 major patterns (oracle-first violation, retry loops, skill_fail bug, build failures, context compaction). L0-2 refined the quantitative claims (build failure rate 31% not 50%, capture density 0.42/entry) and added 4 additional structural observations.

The convergence between L0s is strong: they agree on root causes (path resolution changes breaking downstream tools), impact (elevated retry loops, wasted tokens), and remediation (startup validation, oracle regeneration). The disagreement is only on severity (L0-1 overestimated build failure rate).

**Pattern frequency**: 100% of entries in epoch affected. This is expected for a restructuring session -- the entire session was one continuous infrastructure migration.

### 2. Observation system has blind spots at two scales

The tagger applies signals at session granularity (all entries get identical tags), while the oracle was completely stale during this epoch (100% oracle-first:missed). This creates a double blind spot:

- **Macro scale**: The oracle cannot answer "what changed?" because its concept index reflects pre-restructuring paths. Agents fall back to manual exploration, burning tokens.
- **Micro scale**: Tags cannot distinguish "this specific entry had a CLI failure" from "this session had CLI failures somewhere." Temporal analysis within an epoch requires reading raw entry data.

Both blind spots were independently identified by L0-1 (P1: oracle staleness, P2: signal tag uniformity) and L0-2 (Finding 5: tagger granularity). The combination means the self-improvement loop was partially operating without eyes during this epoch.

**Issues logged**: #285 (oracle-first), #287 (tagger granularity)

### 3. Documentation-enforcement gap: lessons documented but not enforced

Three distinct patterns show the same structural problem -- a lesson is captured, documented in CLAUDE.md, but continues to be violated because no tooling enforces it:

| Lesson | Captures | Documentation | Enforcement | Violation Rate |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Block-wait agents | 3 (1770514455, 1770410983, 1770410296) | CLAUDE.md | None | 0% (fixed by behavioral change) |
| Oracle-first protocol | 1+ (inferred from tags) | CLAUDE.md + sbs-developer.md | None | 100% of entries |
| Regression investigation: diff first | 1 (1770575770) | None | None | Unknown |

The "block-wait agents" case is the success story: repeated failure eventually led to documentation AND behavioral change. But oracle-first has documentation and zero compliance. This suggests documentation alone is insufficient for protocol adherence -- tooling guardrails are needed for high-compliance-required patterns.

**Issues logged**: #290 (triple-capture guardrail pattern), related to #285 (oracle-first)

### 4. Improvement capture density is a reliable friction signal

L0-2 identified that 20 captures in 48 entries (0.42/entry) is anomalously high. Cross-referencing with the entry data confirms this: the captures cluster in the first half of the session (before 15:00 UTC), correlating with the period of highest build failure rate. As infrastructure issues were resolved, capture rate dropped.

This suggests improvement capture rate per epoch is a useful session health metric:
- Healthy: < 0.05 (occasional insights)
- Elevated: 0.05 - 0.20 (notable friction)
- Critical: > 0.20 (session fighting infrastructure)

**Issue logged**: #288

### 5. Contradictory deprecation signal remains unresolved

Improvement capture 1770581343 claims `update-and-archive` is deprecated, but the tool was used extensively in this epoch and remains documented as active in CLAUDE.md. Neither L0 was able to resolve this -- L0-2 explicitly flagged it as "requires user clarification."

This is the only pattern where L1 cannot make a definitive recommendation. Both possibilities (premature capture vs. actual deprecation with stale docs) are plausible.

**Issue logged**: #289

## Improvement Capture Resolution

### Addressed (reflected in issues or documentation)
- **1770514455, 1770410983, 1770410296** (block-wait agents): Now in CLAUDE.md. #276 closed. Behavioral compliance achieved.
- **1770582464** (skill_fail phase_fail): Logged as #284, open.
- **1770580899** (Opus 4.6 overcomplication): CLAUDE.md updated with simplicity matching guidance.
- **1770577361** (stale .olean): Addressed by #281 (closed) -- build script defaults to always-build.
- **1770569654** (EnterPlanMode for plan confirmation): Documented as standard practice.
- **1770513697** (verbose issue logging): sls_issue_log auto-populates archive context. Addressed.
- **1770404208** (L3 findings auto-logged as issues): Implemented in introspection hierarchy.
- **1770402796** (well-researched decomposition): Documented as "Explore-Before-Decompose" pattern in CLAUDE.md.
- **1770351020** (continue executing when agent spawn rejected): Documented as "Doing Mode Detection" in CLAUDE.md.
- **1770307707** (issue handoff friction): sls_issue_log auto-attaches archive context. Addressed.

### Open (unresolved)
- **1770595605** (self-improve infrastructure self-containment): Partially addressed by sls_self_improve MCP tool, but L0/L1 finding document creation still requires manual file writes. No issue yet.
- **1770581343** (update-and-archive deprecation): Ambiguous. Logged as #289 for user resolution.
- **1770578948** (pass raw research output to Plan agent): No enforcement or tooling. Remains a documented recommendation.
- **1770577169** (CSS changes cascading due to build cache): Partially addressed by always-build default. Build cache validation (#1770573994) not implemented.
- **1770575770** (regression investigation: diff first): Documented in improvement capture only. No CLAUDE.md entry or enforcement.
- **1770573994** (build cache validation against rendering expectations): Not implemented. No issue tracks this.
- **1770573283** (QA coverage for proof toggles): Not verified. No issue tracks interactive QA completeness.
- **1770351194** (tests should verify visual outcomes, not property values): Partially addressed by #274 (threshold assertions, closed). General principle not enforced.

## Actions Taken
- Issues logged: #287 (tagger granularity), #288 (capture rate metric), #289 (update-and-archive deprecation), #290 (triple-capture guardrail pattern)
- 4 new issues, within the 5-issue L1 budget

## Recommendations

### Systemic

1. **Regenerate oracle concept index immediately.** The oracle was non-functional for the entire epoch. Until regenerated, oracle-first compliance will remain at 0%. This is prerequisite to measuring whether #285 (oracle-first enforcement) has any effect.

2. **Implement entry-level tagging (#287).** Session-level tags are currently the only discriminator within epochs. Without entry-level signals, temporal analysis of friction patterns requires raw data reading -- defeating the purpose of the tagging system.

3. **Establish a "documentation -> enforcement" graduation pipeline.** When a lesson has been documented for 2+ weeks and violation rate remains > 50%, automatically flag it for guardrail implementation. The oracle-first protocol is the immediate candidate.

4. **Resolve the update-and-archive ambiguity (#289) with user input.** This cannot be determined from archive data alone. One sentence from the user resolves it.

### Process

5. **Cap restructuring sessions at 2 hours or 30 entries.** This epoch's 48 entries and 20 improvement captures indicate the scope exceeded what a single context window can handle effectively. Splitting into focused sessions (path resolution, then CLI rename, then archive fix) would reduce cascading failures and improve tagger discriminatory power.
