## Context

This cluster covers a 5-day low-activity period following the intensive Feb 8 SLS/SBS restructuring session (48 entries, 20 improvement captures). The period contains zero task sessions -- only idle entries from manual triggers and standalone improvement captures. This is the first extended quiescent period observed in the archive system and offers insight into post-session dynamics.

## Findings

### 1. Cooldown reflection pattern: improvement captures cluster after intensive sessions

All 5 improvement captures occurred in a specific temporal pattern:
- **4 of 5** captures were made within 3 hours of the Feb 8 session ending (20:54 - 22:28 UTC on Feb 8)
- **1 capture** on Feb 9 at 13:10 (14 hours later)
- **1 capture** on Feb 14 at 21:06 (5 days later, qualitatively different in nature)

The first burst (Feb 8 evening) represents immediate post-session reflection -- observations that crystallized as the intensive session's friction was fresh in context. The Feb 9 capture about orchestrator role confusion is a deeper structural observation that required distance from the operational details. The Feb 14 capture about graph generation as an MCP tool is forward-looking design thinking, unrelated to the Feb 8 friction.

This suggests a natural "cooldown curve" for improvement capture quality:
- **0-3 hours post-session**: Friction-driven observations (what went wrong, what was painful)
- **12-24 hours**: Structural observations (why the system behaves this way)
- **3+ days**: Forward-looking design observations (how the system should evolve)

### 2. Idle entries inherit session-level signal tags across temporal boundaries

The 3 idle entries (Feb 8, Feb 9, Feb 12) all carry the full signal tag fingerprint from the Feb 8 restructuring session: `signal:consecutive-bash-failures`, `signal:retry-loop`, `signal:cli-misfire`, `signal:high-churn`, `signal:context-compaction`, `oracle-first:missed`.

This is the #287 tagger granularity issue manifesting in a new way. The original finding was that all entries *within* a session get identical tags. Here we see the tags persisting into idle entries created *days* after the session ended. The Feb 12 idle entry (4 days later) still carries `signal:retry-loop` -- a tag that describes the Feb 8 session, not the idle state.

**Root cause**: The tagger evaluates the session-level aggregate and applies it to every entry created while that session is active. Since the Claude Code session was likely the same long-running session being manually triggered at intervals, the session-level analysis never reset.

**Impact**: Searching entries by signal tags during this period returns false positives. An entry tagged `signal:retry-loop` from Feb 12 did not experience retry loops -- it merely exists in a session that did.

This is additional evidence for #287. The proposed fix (entry-level tagging, session-level prefix differentiation) would resolve both the within-session and cross-temporal manifestations.

### 3. High observation-to-action ratio reveals a "reflection debt" accumulation pattern

The Feb 9-14 period has 5 improvement captures and 0 task sessions. Compare this to the Feb 8 session: 20 captures and 48 entries (0.42 captures/entry). The Feb 9-14 period is pure observation with no corresponding implementation.

Looking at what the 5 captures prescribe:
- 1770602096: Use MCP tools instead of bash for build/serve
- 1770606881: Use oracle before grep searches
- 1770607713: Oracle index is missing vscode-lean4 and LeanArchitect RPC
- 1770660658: Orchestrator should use plan approval, not direct skill lifecycle calls
- 1771121194: Graph generation should be an MCP tool call

None of these were acted on during the period. They are all prescriptions for future sessions. This creates "reflection debt" -- a backlog of identified improvements that haven't been implemented or even logged as issues. The L0/L1/L2 introspection cycle from Feb 9 logged many issues (#284-#295), but the captures from this quiescent period went unaddressed until this L0 analysis.

**Pattern**: Intensive sessions generate friction observations. Quiescent periods generate design observations. Neither period addresses the observations from the other. The introspection hierarchy is the mechanism intended to bridge this gap, but it only runs when triggered.

### 4. oracle-first:missed persists at 100% -- 7 days after the issue was logged

Issue #285 was logged on Feb 9 noting 100% oracle-first violation. The 3 idle entries from Feb 9-12 continue to carry `oracle-first:missed`. The Feb 15 entries (from the resumed active session) also carry it. Seven days after identification, there is zero improvement.

This is the strongest evidence yet for #292 (documentation-to-enforcement graduation pipeline). The oracle-first protocol is:
- Documented in CLAUDE.md (Stage 1)
- Tracked by tagging (Stage 1.5)
- Logged as issue #285 (awareness)
- Still violated at 100% (zero compliance)

Without a tooling guardrail (Stage 3 in the #292 pipeline), documentation-only protocols appear to have no measurable effect. The 7-day window between identification and this L0 provides a natural experiment: pure documentation had zero effect.

### 5. Improvement capture 1770607713 reveals an oracle coverage gap

Capture 1770607713 notes: "The vscode-lean4 fork's Blueprint infoview panel and LeanArchitect's RPC.lean are not indexed in the oracle."

This is a concrete, verifiable gap. If the oracle concept index doesn't cover vscode-lean4 and LeanArchitect's RPC module, then agents searching for blueprint infoview functionality will get no oracle hits and fall back to manual exploration -- exactly the pattern described in the oracle-first violation chain.

This is a contributing cause (not just a symptom) of the oracle-first:missed pattern. Agents may be skipping the oracle not just from habit, but because the oracle genuinely cannot answer their queries about these components.

## Actions Taken

- Issues logged: #343 (orchestrator role confusion -- direct skill lifecycle invocation), #345 (agent bash-fallback pattern -- manual commands for MCP-wrapped operations)
- Patterns identified: cooldown reflection curve, tag contamination across temporal boundaries, reflection debt accumulation, oracle-first compliance stagnation, oracle coverage gap as contributing cause

## Recommendations

1. **Trigger oracle concept index regeneration** including vscode-lean4 and LeanArchitect RPC modules. The oracle coverage gap (Finding 5) is a concrete, fixable cause of oracle-first violations. Closing this gap is prerequisite to measuring whether #285 enforcement would actually help.

2. **Implement periodic L0 triggers during quiescent periods.** The 5-day gap between the Feb 8 session and this L0 analysis means 5 improvement captures sat unprocessed. Consider auto-triggering L0 when improvement captures accumulate without a corresponding task session (e.g., 3+ captures with no task session in 48 hours).

3. **Track "reflection debt" as a metric.** Count unprocessed improvement captures (captures not yet reflected in issues, CLAUDE.md updates, or code changes). This period's 5 unprocessed captures should register as a health signal, prompting either issue logging or dismissal.

4. **Use the Feb 9-14 period as a natural experiment for #292.** The oracle-first protocol has been documented for 7 days with zero compliance improvement. This is strong evidence that Stage 1 (documentation) is insufficient for this protocol, supporting escalation to Stage 3 (tooling guardrail).
