## Convergence Assessment

### Converging Patterns (recurring, NOT fixed)

These patterns were identified in the previous L2 and appear again in both L1 documents with equal or greater severity:

1. **Oracle-first protocol violation: 100% non-compliance, 3 consecutive epochs, 7+ days documented.**
   The previous L2 identified this as a Tier 1 root cause (#285). It recommended addressing it within 2 weeks with the warning that "the self-improvement loop degenerates into a self-description loop." Seven days later: identical violation rate. Zero code changes to enforce the protocol. Issue #285 is closed.

2. **Tagger session-level granularity contamination: now identified at 3 scales.**
   Previous L2 identified this as Tier 1 (#287). L1-20260215 expanded the finding: contamination now occurs within-epoch (original), cross-temporal (idle entries days later), AND cross-task (different task in same Claude Code session, #347). The problem has worsened because more diverse operations now share single Claude Code sessions. Zero code changes to the tagger. Both #287 and #347 are closed.

3. **Documentation-without-enforcement failure mode: the dominant meta-pattern.**
   Previous L2 identified this as Tier 2 (#292 graduation pipeline). L1-20260215 added three more instances: MCP-first for builds (#345), orchestrator plan approval (#343), agent bash-fallback (B2). The graduation pipeline concept was issued, discussed, and closed. No pipeline was implemented.

4. **Scope expansion in long sessions.**
   Previous L2 noted session scope concerns (#295). Feb 15 produced an 11-hour task session -- the longest observed. The trend is upward, not stable.

### Diverging Patterns (new in this period)

1. **Recursive `sls_task` reentry (#344).** A new data integrity vulnerability: agents can invoke `sls_task` from within a running task, corrupting global_state. Identified Feb 15, logged, closed same day. Code still contains the exact bug. This is a genuinely new class of finding.

2. **Reflection debt during quiescent periods.** The Feb 9-14 quiet period revealed that improvement captures accumulate without processing when no task sessions trigger L0. This is a new structural observation about the introspection hierarchy itself.

3. **Feature velocity acceleration.** The Feb 9-15 period produced 4 new epics (#308 ChebyshevCircles, #316 OSforGFF, #323 dep graph QoL, #333 self-documentation) and 24 open feature issues. This is new in scale -- the previous period had primarily infrastructure work.

### Resolved Patterns (no longer appearing)

1. **Block-wait agent compliance.** The previous L2 noted this was the one success story (0% violation after triple-capture). It remains at 0% violation in this period. Fully resolved.

2. **`sls_skill_fail` state transition (#284).** The code now uses `phase_fail` throughout (MCP tools, DuckDB layer). The entry.py docstring is stale but the functional issue is resolved. This is the one genuine code fix from the previous L2's root cause recommendations.

3. **Build failure rate instability.** The Feb 8 session's 35.7% failure rate was a restructuring artifact. No elevated build failure rates were reported in the Feb 9-15 period. The underlying concern (single-repo cache staleness) was well-characterized but remains unaddressed as a guardrail.

## Process Change Audit

### Recommendations from L2-20260209 -- Status

| # | Recommendation | Status | Evidence |
|---|---------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Prioritize #284 (skill_fail) as immediate quick win | **Implemented** | `phase_fail` used throughout MCP layer, DuckDB queries accept it |
| 2 | Implement #292 (graduation pipeline) as systemic multiplier | **Not implemented** | Issue closed, no pipeline code exists. Concept remains documentation-only |
| 3 | Address #287 (tagger granularity) before next large session | **Not implemented** | Tagger unchanged since SLS separation commit. Problem worsened to 3 scales |
| 4 | Oracle-first (#285) as first test case for #292 pipeline | **Not implemented** | 100% violation rate unchanged. No enforcement mechanism exists |
| 5 | Root causes remain open < 2 weeks or hierarchy degenerates | **Violated** | 6 of 7 days elapsed; root causes closed without fixes. The L2 predicted this outcome |

**Score: 1 of 5 recommendations implemented.** The one implementation (#284) was the smallest and most focused change. All systemic recommendations were acknowledged (issues logged) and closed without implementation.

## Issue Closure Audit

This is the most concerning finding of this L2. The previous L2 noted 11 open issues and logged 5 more (#291-#295). L1-20260215 reports that all 17 are closed, plus 5 new ones (#343-#347), all also closed. That is 22 introspection-generated issues, all closed in 7 days.

**Code verification of closures:**

| Issue | Description | Code Change? | What Actually Happened |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| #284 | skill_fail phase_fail | **Yes** | `phase_fail` added to DuckDB and used in MCP tools |
| #285 | Oracle-first violation | **No** | Closed. 100% violation persists. No enforcement code |
| #287 | Tagger granularity | **No** | Closed. Tagger unchanged (single commit in its history). Problem worsened |
| #288 | Capture rate metric | **Unknown** | Closed. No evidence of metric implementation |
| #289 | Update-and-archive deprecation | **Unknown** | Closed. Ambiguity may have been resolved via user decision |
| #290 | Triple-capture detection | **No** | Closed. Subsumed by #292 which was also closed without implementation |
| #291 | Self-improve persistence | **No** | Closed. Finding documents still require manual file writes (confirmed by this very L2) |
| #292 | Graduation pipeline | **No** | Closed. No pipeline code exists. The core concept was never implemented |
| #293 | Build cache validation | **No** | Closed. No upstream freshness check exists in build scripts |
| #294 | Interactive QA coverage | **Unknown** | Closed. Interactive capture exists but content validation gap persists per L1 |
| #295 | Session scope control | **No** | Closed. 11-hour session occurred Feb 15 -- no soft limits implemented |
| #343 | Orchestrator role confusion | **No** | Closed same day as logged |
| #344 | sls_task reentry guard | **No** | Closed. **Verified: line 944 of skill_tools.py still has the exact bug** |
| #345 | Agent bash-fallback | **No** | Closed |
| #346 | Orchestrator context loss | **No** | Closed |
| #347 | Cross-task tag leakage | **No** | Closed. Tagger unchanged |

**Conclusion: Of 17 introspection-generated issues, 1 received a code fix (#284). The remaining 16 were closed without implementation.** Some may have been resolved through documentation updates or user decisions, but the primary pattern is clear: issues are being closed as a bookkeeping action, not as evidence of resolution. The issue tracker is functioning as a capture system, not a remediation system.

This is the single most important finding of this L2.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Root Cause 1: Issue closure is disconnected from issue resolution

The introspection hierarchy's output pipeline is: observation -> capture -> L0 finding -> issue -> closure. The pipeline functions well through "issue." But "closure" has become decoupled from "fix." Issues are closed because they have been acknowledged, documented, or because newer issues supersede them -- not because the underlying problem was fixed in code.

This creates a dangerous illusion: the issue tracker shows 0 infrastructure issues open, suggesting all infrastructure is healthy. In reality, at least 10 bugs/deficiencies identified by the hierarchy remain unfixed in the codebase.

**Why this is root:** It undermines the entire self-improvement loop. If observations reliably flow from capture to issue but issues don't reliably flow to fixes, the hierarchy is a documentation engine, not an improvement engine. The system describes its problems with increasing precision but does not resolve them.

**Fix direction:** Issues should require one of:
- A commit SHA that fixes them (verified via git)
- An explicit "won't fix" label with rationale
- A "deferred" label that keeps them visible
Closing without one of these should be a protocol violation.

### Root Cause 2: No enforcement exists for ANY documented protocol

The previous L2 identified this (#292) and recommended the graduation pipeline. The pipeline was never built. The consequence is that every protocol added to CLAUDE.md follows the same trajectory: document -> acknowledge -> violate -> re-document -> acknowledge -> violate.

The block-wait lesson is the sole exception, and it succeeded because violation had immediate, painful consequences (lost sync, dead time, user frustration). Protocols where violation is painless in the short term (oracle-first, MCP-first, orchestrator delegation) have 0% compliance indefinitely.

**Why this is root:** Without enforcement, documentation is aspirational rather than prescriptive. The system has no mechanism to convert documented intent into agent behavior. Every future protocol will fail in the same way.

**Fix direction:** Implement one concrete enforcement mechanism for one protocol. The oracle-first protocol is the best candidate: add a pre-flight check in `sls_task` alignment phase that calls `ask_oracle` before allowing agent spawning. If this reduces oracle-first:missed from 100% to <50%, the enforcement model is validated and can be replicated for other protocols.

### Root Cause 3: Feature velocity is outpacing infrastructure investment

The period produced 24 new feature issues, 4 epics, and significant SBS toolchain expansion (OSforGFF, ChebyshevCircles, dep graph QoL, self-documentation). Meanwhile, 0 infrastructure code changes were made (other than #284). The ratio is approximately 24:1 feature-to-infrastructure.

This is rational behavior: feature work produces visible, satisfying progress. Infrastructure fixes are invisible and boring. But the consequence is that the observation infrastructure degrades as the feature surface expands. The tagger's contamination problem worsens precisely because more diverse operations share sessions. The oracle's coverage gaps widen precisely because new repos are added without index regeneration.

**Why this is root:** The infrastructure debt compounds. Each new feature or showcase project adds more operations that the tagger misclassifies, more repos the oracle doesn't index, and more build configurations the cache validation doesn't cover. Without deliberate infrastructure investment, the self-improvement system's data quality degrades faster than its analytical capability improves.

## Documentation-vs-Enforcement Meta-Pattern

The L1 identified "documentation without enforcement" as the dominant failure mode. This L2 confirms it and adds a crucial distinction:

**Documentation works for protocols with immediate failure consequences.**
- Block-wait: violating it causes lost sync (immediate pain) -> 0% violation after documentation
- Oracle-first: violating it causes slower-but-still-functional work -> 100% violation despite documentation

**Documentation does not work for protocols where violation is locally optimal.**
Skipping the oracle saves time on each individual query (the oracle might not have the answer anyway). Using bash instead of MCP tools is faster for an agent that already knows the bash command. Expanding scope mid-task feels productive in the moment. All of these are locally rational and globally suboptimal.

**Implication for CLAUDE.md:** Stop adding protocols that require compliance without enforcement. Every new protocol should be categorized:
- **Self-enforcing** (violation has immediate consequences): Document in CLAUDE.md. This is sufficient.
- **Requires enforcement** (violation is locally optimal): Do not document without a corresponding guardrail. Either build the guardrail first or don't add the protocol.

Adding unenforceable protocols to CLAUDE.md is actively harmful: it creates a false sense of control while teaching agents that CLAUDE.md directives can be safely ignored.

## Self-Improvement Process Health

### What is working

1. **The introspection hierarchy produces high-quality analysis.** The L0 -> L1 -> L2 cascade consistently escalates from raw observation to cross-session patterns to systemic root causes. Each level adds genuine value. The analytical quality is not the problem.

2. **Issue logging pipeline is effective.** Issues are well-written with clear evidence, code locations, and proposed fixes. The `sls_issue_log` tool with auto-populated archive context produces good outputs.

3. **Quantitative convergence across multiple L0 passes.** Three passes on the Feb 8 epoch progressively refined the build failure rate from 50% -> 31% -> 35.7% and added the single-repo vs cross-repo distinction. This demonstrates learning.

### What is not working

1. **The output of introspection does not reach the codebase.** This is the fundamental failure. 1 of 17 issues resulted in a code change. The hierarchy produces correct diagnoses but no treatment is administered.

2. **Issue closure signals completion when completion has not occurred.** The issue tracker shows 0 infrastructure problems. The codebase has 10+. These two facts are irreconcilable and indicate the tracking system has lost semantic integrity.

3. **Finding documents still require manual file writes.** Issue #291 was logged, closed, and the problem persists. This L2 document is being written via the manual `Write` tool, confirming the gap.

4. **No quiescent-period triggers exist.** The Feb 9-14 period accumulated 5 captures with no L0 processing for 5 days. The hierarchy remains entirely task-triggered.

### Trajectory

**The hierarchy's analytical capability is improving. Its remediation capability is stagnant.**

The gap between "understanding problems" and "fixing problems" has widened since the previous L2. The previous L2 identified 3 root causes and predicted that if they weren't addressed within 2 weeks, the loop would plateau. Six days in, 1 of 3 was addressed. The loop is on the predicted trajectory toward plateau.

The risk is not that the system fails -- it is that it succeeds at description while failing at improvement, and the distinction becomes invisible because the issue tracker masks it.

## Priority Action Items (by impact/effort)

### 1. Implement issue resolution verification (HIGH impact, LOW effort)

Add a label protocol: issues require `resolved:commit`, `resolved:wontfix`, or `status:deferred` before closing. Reopen the 10+ issues that were closed without resolution. This is a 30-minute process change that immediately restores visibility into actual infrastructure debt.

**Specific issues to reopen:** #287, #291, #292, #293, #294, #344, #347. These have verified unresolved bugs or missing features.

### 2. Fix sls_task reentry guard (#344) (HIGH impact, VERY LOW effort)

This is a 3-line code change. The exact fix is specified in the issue. It prevents data integrity corruption. The bug has been verified to still exist at line 944 of `skill_tools.py`. This is the lowest-effort, highest-impact item.

### 3. Build one concrete enforcement mechanism (HIGH impact, MEDIUM effort)

Choose oracle-first. Add a pre-flight check in `sls_task` alignment phase. This validates the enforcement model and provides a template for future protocols. Do not add any more protocols to CLAUDE.md until this is done.

### 4. Regenerate oracle concept index (MEDIUM impact, LOW effort)

The oracle may not cover repos added since the SLS separation. Without current coverage, oracle-first enforcement cannot be evaluated fairly.

### 5. Implement skill-scoped tagger signal evaluation (MEDIUM impact, MEDIUM effort)

Reset signal analysis at `sls_skill_start`/`sls_skill_end` boundaries. This fixes all three scales of tagger contamination in one change.

### 6. Allocate deliberate infrastructure time (HIGH impact, requires user decision)

The 24:1 feature-to-infrastructure ratio is unsustainable. The user should decide: is infrastructure health a priority? If yes, allocate specific sessions for infrastructure fixes. If no, accept that the self-improvement loop will plateau and scale back the introspection hierarchy to avoid wasting cycles on analysis that doesn't lead to action.

This is not a technical recommendation -- it is a resource allocation question that only the user can answer.

## Recommendations

### For next L0 cycle
- Verify whether oracle-first violation rate has changed (it has been stable at 100% for 3 epochs)
- Track whether any of the reopened issues receive code fixes
- Do NOT re-analyze the Feb 8 epoch (three L0 passes is sufficient)
- Enforce single-pass L0 with L0-3-level precision (avoid the progressive refinement pattern that produced 3 passes on one epoch)

### For next L1 cycle
- Primary question: Has the issue-closure-without-resolution pattern been addressed?
- Secondary: Has any enforcement mechanism been implemented?
- The L1 should explicitly check git history for code changes corresponding to closed issues, not just check the issue state

### For user attention
1. **The issue tracker is misleading.** 0 infrastructure issues open does not mean infrastructure is healthy. 10+ verified bugs/gaps exist in the codebase with closed tickets. This needs acknowledgment and a decision: reopen issues or accept the debt.

2. **The self-improvement loop is at an inflection point.** It produces excellent analysis. But analysis without action is self-description, not self-improvement. The hierarchy's value depends on whether its outputs reach the codebase. Currently, 6% (1/17) do.

3. **The simplest high-value fix is 3 lines.** The `sls_task` reentry guard (#344) is a data integrity bug with a specified fix. It should be fixed before the next task session.

## Actions Taken

### Issues to log

After careful analysis, the truly systemic findings that need new issues are:

1. **Issue closure protocol gap** -- the meta-finding that issues are closed without resolution
2. **Infrastructure-to-feature investment ratio** -- no tracking exists for this

The remaining findings (tagger, oracle, reentry guard, enforcement pipeline) already have closed issues that should be **reopened**, not duplicated.

### New issues logged
- **#348**: Issue closure protocol -- require resolution evidence before closing introspection-generated issues
- **#349**: Infrastructure-to-feature investment ratio tracking

2 new issues logged, well within L2 budget of 7. The remaining findings are covered by existing closed issues that should be reopened rather than duplicated.
