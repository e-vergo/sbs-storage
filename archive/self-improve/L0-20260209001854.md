# L0 Introspection Finding -- 2026-02-09T00:18:54Z

## Session Context
- Level: L0
- Entries analyzed: 48 (IDs 1770574235 through 1770595605)
- Improvement captures analyzed: 20
- Issues correlated: #284, #285, #286 (logged by prior L0), #283, #282, #224
- Prior L0 in epoch: L0-20260209000953.md (same epoch, ~9 min earlier)

## Context

This is a second L0 pass over the same epoch (Feb 8, 2026 SLS/SBS restructuring session). The prior L0 logged 3 issues covering the major signal patterns. This pass focuses on refinement: what did the prior L0 miss, and what deeper structure exists in the data?

## Findings

1. **Build failure rate is 31%, not 50%**: The prior L0 estimated "50% of build entries" failed. Precise count from `trigger:build` entries: 4 failures (1770580317, 1770577386, 1770574770, 1770574241) out of 13 build-triggered entries = 30.8%. Still elevated above a healthy baseline (target: <10%), but the prior L0 overstated the severity. Three of four failures occurred in the first half of the session (before 14:55 UTC), suggesting the restructuring path resolution issues were resolved progressively.

2. **Improvement capture density is anomalously high**: 20 improvement captures in a single epoch of 48 entries yields a rate of 0.42 captures per entry. For comparison, a healthy session might produce 1-3 captures. This 20-capture session signals extreme friction. The captures cluster into three categories: tooling gaps (6), process anti-patterns (5), workflow/orchestration (4), with 5 miscellaneous. The tooling gap category dominates, consistent with a session that spent most of its time fighting infrastructure rather than doing productive work.

3. **"Block-wait agents" lesson required 3 separate captures across different sessions**: Captures 1770514455, 1770410983, and 1770410296 all record the same lesson -- do not run agents in background. This triple-capture pattern (same lesson, different sessions) is a strong signal that the failure mode was deeply embedded in agent behavior and required repeated correction before it stuck. It is now documented in CLAUDE.md. This pattern of "repeated capture before internalization" could be a useful meta-signal for identifying lessons that need stronger enforcement (not just documentation but tooling guardrails).

4. **Documentation contradicts deprecation signal**: Improvement capture 1770581343 states "update-and-archive has been deprecated" and recommends removing references. However, CLAUDE.md continues to list `sls_update_and_archive` as an active workflow tool, and it ran multiple times during this epoch. This is either a premature deprecation signal or actual documentation debt. The ambiguity means no issue was logged -- this requires user clarification.

5. **All 48 entries show identical signal tag fingerprint**: Every entry has the exact same set of signal tags (retry-loop, cli-misfire, consecutive-bash-failures, same-command-retry, high-churn, context-compaction). This uniformity confirms the prior L0's hypothesis (P2) but also reveals a tagger limitation: the signals are applied at session level, not entry level. This is the exact issue tracked by #237 (tag signal pipeline via DuckDB). The tags provide no discriminatory power within an epoch when they're identical across all entries.

## Actions Taken
- Issues logged: None (prior L0 already logged #284, #285, #286 for this epoch)
- Patterns identified: build failure temporal clustering, improvement capture density as friction metric, triple-capture as internalization signal, tagger granularity limitation
- Documentation inconsistency flagged (update-and-archive deprecation vs. active documentation)

## Recommendations

1. **Track improvement capture rate per epoch** as a session health metric. Rate > 0.2 captures/entry indicates severe friction and should trigger review of session scope.
2. **Add temporal analysis to build failure tracking**: Build failures clustered in early session indicate "ramp-up friction" (acceptable); failures throughout indicate systemic issues (concerning).
3. **Use "triple-capture" detection** as a signal for lessons needing tooling enforcement, not just documentation. When the same insight appears 3+ times across sessions, consider whether a guardrail (check, warning, or block) is warranted.
4. **Resolve update-and-archive deprecation ambiguity** with user: is it deprecated or not? If deprecated, update CLAUDE.md. If not, close the improvement capture.
5. **No additional issues warranted for this epoch** -- prior L0 coverage was thorough. Future L1 should synthesize across multiple L0 findings to identify cross-session trends.
