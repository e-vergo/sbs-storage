## Systemic Analysis

### Convergence/Divergence

**Strong convergence across levels.** L0-1 and L0-2 independently identified the same 5 core problems from different angles (qualitative vs quantitative). L1 confirmed all patterns and found no contradictions between the two L0s. The only disagreement was quantitative: L0-1 estimated 50% build failure rate, L0-2 corrected to 31%. This is healthy -- the hierarchy is self-correcting on precision while agreeing on direction.

**Pattern trajectory:** The Feb 8 epoch was dominated by a single event (SLS/SBS repo restructuring) that produced cascading infrastructure failures. This is a one-time event, not a recurring pattern. The *response* to the event, however, revealed systemic weaknesses that persist independently of the trigger:

1. The observation layer (tagger, oracle) degrades under load and cannot self-heal mid-session
2. Documented protocols have zero enforcement mechanisms
3. Build cache invalidation across submodules has no formal validation
4. Interactive QA does not verify content of interactive states

These four weaknesses existed before the restructuring and will persist after it. The restructuring merely made them visible by applying extreme stress.

### Root Cause Analysis

The 11 open issues can be organized into a causal hierarchy:

**Tier 1: Root Causes (fix these and downstream symptoms improve)**

| Issue | Category | Why It's Root |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| #287 (tagger granularity) | Observation | The observation layer is the foundation for all introspection. Without entry-level discrimination, L0/L1 findings are based on uniform distributions -- they can identify session-level patterns but cannot locate specific problematic entries. This limits the precision of every introspection level. |
| #285 (oracle-first violation) | Enforcement | The oracle-first protocol exists to reduce token waste from blind exploration. 100% violation means agents spend tokens on Grep/Glob searches that the oracle could answer in one call. This is a direct contributor to context compaction (#295). |
| #284 (skill_fail state transition) | State machine | Failed skills leave global state stuck. This forces workarounds (using skill_end instead) that lose semantic information about failure modes, degrading the archive's ability to distinguish success from failure. |

**Tier 2: Structural Weaknesses (require dedicated effort)**

| Issue | Category | Why It's Structural |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| #292 (doc-to-enforcement pipeline) | Process | Subsumes #285 and #290 into a general framework. Without this pipeline, every new documented protocol will follow the same trajectory: capture -> document -> violate -> re-capture -> eventually enforce by convention. |
| #291 (self-improve persistence) | Infrastructure | The introspection hierarchy's output mechanism is manual file writes, making it fragile and non-discoverable by other tools. |
| #293 (build cache validation) | Build | Cross-submodule staleness causes false debugging cycles that waste significant session time. |
| #294 (interactive QA coverage) | Quality | Regressions in interactive states escape detection until users encounter them. |

**Tier 3: Symptoms / Measurements**

| Issue | Category | Why It's a Symptom |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| #288 (capture rate metric) | Measurement | Useful signal, but measuring friction doesn't reduce it. Addressing root causes (#287, #293) would reduce capture rates organically. |
| #289 (update-and-archive deprecation) | Ambiguity | Requires user decision, not systemic fix. |
| #290 (triple-capture detection) | Meta-signal | Subsumed by #292 (graduation pipeline). The triple-capture pattern is a symptom of the doc-enforcement gap. |
| #295 (session scope control) | Process | Mitigates observation degradation but doesn't fix the underlying tagger and oracle limitations. |

**Non-introspection issues:**
- #224 (Epic: SBS Rewrite) -- product roadmap, not infrastructure
- #223 (Reductive Groups showcase) -- content, not process
- #282 (SBS-Test coverage) -- feature gap, not systemic
- #283 (delimiter migration) -- technical debt, not systemic

### Process Health

**What's working:**

1. **Introspection hierarchy is functioning.** This is the first full L0->L1->L2 cycle. The hierarchy successfully escalated from raw signal analysis (L0) to cross-session patterns (L1) to systemic root causes (L2). Each level added genuine analytical value -- not just repetition.

2. **Improvement capture mechanism is effective.** 20 captures in one epoch is a lot, but the captures correctly identified the problems. 10 of 20 have been addressed (documented, fixed, or issued). The remaining 10 are tracked.

3. **Issue logging pipeline works well.** `sls_issue_log` with auto-populated archive context produces high-quality issues. The L0 and L1 agents logged 7 issues total, all with clear evidence and proposed solutions.

4. **Block-wait agents lesson stuck.** After 3 captures across different sessions, the behavioral change was internalized AND documented. This is the success story for the "triple-capture -> enforcement" pattern.

**What's not working:**

1. **Oracle-first compliance is zero.** The protocol is documented in two places (CLAUDE.md, sbs-developer.md) but has no enforcement. The tagger detects violations but there's no feedback loop that causes agents to change behavior. This is the clearest example of the doc-enforcement gap.

2. **Observation layer degrades under load.** The tagger, oracle, and epoch summary tools are designed for moderate-load sessions. A 48-entry epoch with high friction overwhelmed all three, producing uniform tags, stale oracle data, and a single oversized epoch.

3. **Self-improve output is fragile.** Finding documents are manually written files with convention-based paths. If an agent fails mid-introspection, no partial output is preserved. The archive has no way to discover finding documents through its normal search/query mechanisms.

4. **Build cache validation is absent.** The always-build default prevents the worst case (stale .olean) but doesn't catch cross-submodule staleness. This contributes directly to the elevated build failure rate.

**Trajectory assessment:** The system health is **improving** overall. This epoch was dominated by a one-time restructuring event that exposed latent weaknesses. The fact that the introspection hierarchy identified, quantified, and triaged those weaknesses within a single L0->L1->L2 cycle is itself evidence that the self-improvement loop is working. The key risk is that the identified root causes (#287, #285, #284) remain open -- if they persist for 2+ weeks, the improvement loop will plateau.

## Issue Triage

### Root causes (fix first)
- #284: `sls_skill_fail` invalid state transition (small fix, high value)
- #285: Oracle-first systematic violation (needs enforcement mechanism)
- #287: Tagger session-level granularity (architectural change in tagger)

### Structural weaknesses (dedicated effort)
- #291: Self-improve finding persistence (new MCP tool)
- #292: Documentation-to-enforcement graduation pipeline (process + tooling)
- #293: Build cache cross-submodule validation (build tooling)
- #294: Interactive QA content verification (QA tooling)

### Symptoms / measurements
- #288: Capture rate metric (low effort, useful signal)
- #289: Update-and-archive deprecation (user decision needed)
- #290: Triple-capture detection (subsumed by #292)
- #295: Session scope control (mitigates observation degradation)

### Quick wins
- #284 (add `phase_fail` to valid state transitions -- likely a 1-line fix)
- #288 (compute capture rate in epoch summary -- small addition)
- #289 (ask user one question to resolve ambiguity)

## Actions Taken

- Issues logged: #291 (self-improve persistence), #292 (doc-to-enforcement pipeline), #293 (build cache validation), #294 (interactive QA coverage), #295 (session scope control)
- 5 new issues, within the 7-issue L2 budget
- Root cause / symptom triage established for all 16 open issues (11 pre-existing + 5 new)

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Prioritize #284 as the immediate quick win.** It's likely a 1-line fix (add `phase_fail` to the archive CLI's valid state transitions) and unblocks proper failure tracking across the entire skill lifecycle.

2. **Implement #292 (graduation pipeline) as the systemic multiplier.** This is the highest-leverage issue because it provides a framework for enforcing ANY documented protocol, not just oracle-first. It turns the recurring doc-enforcement gap from a per-protocol problem into a solved infrastructure problem.

3. **Address #287 (tagger granularity) before the next large session.** If another restructuring-class event occurs with session-level tagging, the introspection hierarchy will be partially blind again. Entry-level signals are prerequisite for meaningful L0 analysis.

4. **The oracle-first problem (#285) should be the first test case for #292.** It has clear violation metrics (100% of entries tagged `oracle-first:missed`), a documented protocol, and a measurable success criterion (reduction in the tag frequency). If the graduation pipeline can reduce oracle-first violations from 100% to <20%, the pipeline is validated.

5. **Do not let root cause issues (#284, #285, #287) remain open for more than 2 weeks.** The L1 finding identified that documentation without enforcement has a ~0% compliance rate. If root causes persist without enforcement, the introspection hierarchy documents the same problems repeatedly without progress -- the self-improvement loop degenerates into a self-description loop.
