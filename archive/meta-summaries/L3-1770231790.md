## 1. Skill Evolution Trajectory

The L2 self-improvement system has evolved through three distinct phases across 5 cycles:

### Phase 1: Discovery (C1-C2)
- Identifying surface patterns ("simplicity signals", "doing mode detection")
- Basic metrics collection (quality 3.2%, tags 0.0)
- High issue count (7+7 = 14 issues in 2 cycles)
- Process improvements dominate findings

### Phase 2: Recognition (C3)
- Critical meta-insight: "closure ≠ resolution"
- Observation layer debt identified as structural, not incremental
- Explicit redirection from incremental fixes to architectural solutions (DuckDB for tags, build pipeline for quality)
- Shift from "fix what exists" to "replace what doesn't work"

### Phase 3: Refinement (C4-C5)
- Finding depth increases, count decreases (3→5 vs. previous 7-8)
- Guidance verification debt quantified (~21 additions, ~4 verified)
- Improvement capture tool adopted (3 uses across C4-C5)
- Batched dialogue phase validated (reduced from 1688s to single-batch review)
- System stabilizing: fewer novel problems, deeper analysis

### Trajectory Assessment

The system is learning to distinguish implementation problems (fixable with code) from architectural problems (requiring redesign). This is healthy maturation.

**Finding categories evolution:**
```
C1: "we don't know X", "we can't measure Y"
C2: "the fix for X didn't go far enough"
C3: "incremental fixes don't work for X, need structural change"
C4: "we're creating unverified guidance faster than we validate it"
C5: "auto-tags are session-level, not entry-level" (architectural clarity)
```

**Key trend:** The system is maturing from discovery to architectural recognition. However, it's accumulating unverified guidance faster than it can validate behavioral change - a new form of technical debt.

**Meta-observation:** L2 cycles produce insights faster than execution validates them. This creates a feedback loop design flaw: L2 closes the discovery→documentation loop but lacks a validation→pruning loop.

---

## 2. Recurring Friction Inventory

Problems appearing in 3+ L2 documents despite being "addressed":

### Auto-Tag Discrimination (All 5 cycles)

**Persistence pattern:**
- **C1:** Tags fire uniformly (73% entries), 0.0 signal score → #110 logged
- **C2:** Per-session scoping added (#110 closed), tags still 0.0 signal → #121 logged
- **C3:** Rules redesigned (#121 closed), tags STILL 0.0 signal → #138 defers to DuckDB
- **C4:** Acknowledged as architectural, not fixable incrementally
- **C5:** Identified as session-level not entry-level → #160 logged

**What persistence reveals:** Rule-based tag classification is the wrong abstraction. Five cycles of incremental fixes produced zero metric improvement. The system now recognizes this and has redirected to DuckDB architectural solution, but that solution hasn't been implemented.

**Intervention types attempted:** Code fixes (#110, #121), architectural redirect (#138), architectural clarification (#160)

**Resolution strategy:** Tags remain at 0.0 signal. DuckDB path (#118, #138) is designated fix but unimplemented for 3 cycles. Further incremental fixes are futile.

---

### Quality Score Coverage (All 5 cycles)

**Persistence pattern:**
- **C1:** 3.2% coverage, identified as high-impact gap → #111 logged
- **C2:** 3.2% unchanged, investigated but deferred
- **C3:** 3.1% unchanged despite 100% closure of related issues
- **C4:** 3.1% unchanged → #143 (build integration) logged
- **C5:** 3.0% unchanged, #143 closed but unverified

**What persistence reveals:** Standalone tooling is the wrong delivery mechanism. The fix (#143 build pipeline integration) was closed in C5 but hasn't been exercised via build yet, so metric remains unmoved. This is another instance of "closure ≠ resolution."

**Intervention types attempted:** Investigation (#111), architectural redirect (#143)

**Resolution strategy:** Quality score integration into build.py implemented but unverified. A single build run should verify whether coverage jumps to >30%. Until that build occurs, the 5-cycle stagnation continues.

---

### Guidance Verification Gap (C3-C5)

**Persistence pattern:**
- **C3:** Known docs not consulted despite being in CLAUDE.md → #136, #137 logged
- **C4:** Explicit finding "~14 guidance additions, 2 verified"
- **C5:** Debt compounding "~21 additions, ~4 verified" → #164 logged for protocol

**What persistence reveals:** The L2 loop produces insights → documentation faster than execution validates them. This creates:
1. **False confidence:** Assume problems solved because guidance exists
2. **Noise accumulation:** Good and bad advice indistinguishable
3. **Search burden:** More docs = harder to find relevant patterns

**Intervention types attempted:** Guidance additions (12+ items), protocol definition (#164)

**Resolution strategy:** Issue #164 establishes verification protocol, but it's been logged not implemented. The gap will continue compounding until L2 cycles include verification sampling (already defined in SKILL.md but unused in C1-C5).

---

### Finalization as Most Common Failure Substate (C2-C5)

**Persistence pattern:**
- Mentioned in C2, C3, C4, C5 MCP findings as most common failure substate
- 85-88% task completion means 12-15% incompletion, concentrated in finalization
- **C1 hypothesis:** Context compaction in long sessions disrupts ceremony
- **No verification:** Never investigated deeper despite recurring across 4 cycles

**What persistence reveals:** This may be a measurement artifact (finalization is the last phase, so failures elsewhere still show as "didn't reach finalization") or genuine pattern. Four cycles of observation without investigation suggests it's accepted as background noise rather than actionable friction.

**Intervention types attempted:** None

**Resolution strategy:** Needs investigation. Use `sbs_search_entries` to find finalization entries with failure signals and classify modes.

## 3. Metric Trajectory Analysis

Quantitative metrics extracted from all L2 documents:

| Metric | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Trend |
|--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **Task completion** | 85% | 85.7% | 86.7% | 87.2% | 87.8% | ↗ Improving |
| **Plan approval rate** | 100% (29/29) | 100% (30/30) | 100% (31/31) | 100% (31/31) | 100% (33/33) | ✓ Stable |
| **Backward transitions** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ✓ Stable |
| **Gate failures** | 0/24 | 0/22 | 0/26 | 0/26 | 0/28 | ✓ Stable |
| **Interruption rate** | 1/85 | 1/97 | 2/103 | 2/103 | 2/109 | ✓ Stable |
| **Quality coverage** | 3.2% | 3.2% | 3.1% | 3.1% | 3.0% | ↔ Stagnant |
| **Tag signal score** | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | ↔ Stagnant |
| **Issues logged** | 7 | 7 | 8 | 3 | 5 | ↓ Decreasing |
| **Closure rate (prev cycle)** | - | 71% (5/7) | 100% (7/7) | 75% (6/8) | 100% (5/5) | ↗ Improving |
| **Guidance verified** | 2/7 | ? | ~2/15 | ~2/16 | ~4/21 | ↔ Lagging |

### Plateaus
- **Plan approval:** 100% since C1 - cannot improve further, structural ceiling reached
- **Gate failures:** 0% since C1 - cannot improve further, structural ceiling reached
- **Backward transitions:** 0% since C1 - cannot improve further, structural ceiling reached
- **Quality coverage:** Stuck at ~3% for all 5 cycles - architectural intervention pending
- **Tag signal:** Stuck at 0.0 for all 5 cycles - architectural intervention pending

### Improvements
- **Task completion:** 85% → 87.8% (+2.8pp over 5 cycles, +0.56pp per cycle avg)
  - Linear trend suggests approaching plateau around 90%
- **Closure rate:** 71% → 100% (but C3 identified this as misleading metric)
- **Interruption rate:** Stable at ~2/109 (1.8%, excellent)

### Regressions
- **None in operational metrics** - system is stable
- **Issues logged decreasing:** 7→5 reflects maturation (fewer novel problems) not deterioration

### Stuck Areas
- **Quality coverage and tag signal:** Structural issues requiring architectural intervention (#143 for quality, DuckDB for tags)
- **Guidance verification:** Process gap requiring new validation loop (#164)

### Directional Indicators

**Accelerating:** None (all operational metrics plateaued at excellence)
**Stable/Improving:** Task completion (+0.56pp/cycle), closure efficiency (100%)
**Stagnant:** Quality coverage (3.0%), tag signal (0.0), guidance verification (20%)
**Deteriorating:** None

**Overall assessment:** Operational metrics have plateaued at excellence. Improvement opportunity now concentrated in measurement/observation infrastructure.

## 4. Intervention Effectiveness

Classifying 30 issues logged across C1-C5 by type and tracking resolution:

### By Intervention Type

| Type | Count | Examples | Closure Rate |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Guidance addition** | 14 | #112 (simplicity), #113 (doing mode), #127 (triage), #136 (pre-flight), #137 (consult docs), #139 (quantitative), #140 (taxonomy tests), #152 (explore-before-ask), #164 (verification) | 86% (12/14) |
| **Code fix** | 6 | #115 (T6 threshold), #123 (MCP caching), #126 (question_stats), #141 (boundary), #153 (serve errors), #161 (gh CLI) | 100% (6/6) |
| **Investigation** | 3 | #114 (task incompletion), #142 (improvement_capture), #162 (test simulation) | 100% (3/3) |
| **Architectural redirect** | 4 | #110→#121→#138 (tags to DuckDB), #111→#143 (quality to build), #160 (tag granularity) | 50% (2/4) |
| **Protocol definition** | 3 | #116 (compress finalization), #154 (metric verification), #164 (guidance verification) | 67% (2/3) |

### Resolution vs Outcome

| Type | Closed | Verified | Resolution % | Outcome % |
|------|--------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Code fix** | 6/6 (100%) | ~5/6 (83%) | 100% | 83% |
| **Guidance addition** | 12/14 (86%) | ~2/14 (14%) | 86% | 14% |
| **Investigation** | 3/3 (100%) | 1/3 (33%) | 100% | 33% |
| **Architectural redirect** | 2/4 (50%) | 0/4 (0%) | 50% | 0% |
| **Protocol definition** | 2/3 (67%) | 1/3 (33%) | 67% | 33% |

### Which Intervention Types Produce Verifiable Results

#### Effective (High Outcome %)
- **Code fixes:** #115 T6 threshold, #123 MCP caching, #126 question_stats - closed and verified in subsequent sessions
- **Guidance with immediate validation:** #127 triage waves verified in C2 crush, #116 compressed finalization verified in C2 triage

#### Ineffective (Low Outcome %)
- **Guidance without validation opportunity:** ~12 additions across C2-C5, unverified
- **Architectural interventions:** Tags/quality still at 0.0/3.0% after 5 cycles despite multiple redirects

### Closure Timeline

| Issues Logged | Cycle Logged | Closure Cycle | Lag (Cycles) |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| #110-116 (C1) | C1 | C2 (5/7), C3 (2/7) | 1-2 |
| #121-127 (C2) | C2 | C3 (7/7) | 1 |
| #136-143 (C3) | C3 | C4 (6/8), C5 (2/8) | 1-2 |
| #152-154 (C4) | C4 | C5 (5/5) | 1 |
| #160-164 (C5) | C5 | Pending | - |

**Average closure lag:** 1.2 cycles (very efficient)

### Key Findings

1. **Code fixes are most effective:** 100% closure, 83% verification. When the fix is code, it works.
2. **Guidance additions are efficient but unverified:** 86% closure, 14% verification. Easy to close (add text to SKILL.md), hard to validate (requires future sessions).
3. **Architectural interventions are pending:** 50% closure, 0% verification. These require engineering work outside L2 scope.
4. **Closure efficiency is misleading:** High closure rates (71% → 100%) don't correlate with problem resolution (quality/tags unmoved).

**Conclusion:** The system is efficient at closing issues but inefficient at verifying outcomes. Interventions that can be validated immediately (code fixes, guidance used in same cycle) succeed. Interventions requiring future sessions to validate (most guidance) accumulate as debt.

---

## 5. Observation Layer Meta-Assessment

Is the improvement system observing the right things?

### Coverage Gaps: What ISN'T Being Measured

**What IS being measured:**
- Task completion, plan approval, gate failures, backward transitions (all operational metrics)
- Issue count, closure rate (process metrics)
- Retrospective narratives (qualitative, high-fidelity but not aggregatable)

**What ISN'T being measured:**
- **Guidance adoption rate:** No tool to scan sessions for prescribed behaviors
- **Problem resolution vs issue closure:** Metrics don't track outcome, only process
- **Entry-level characteristics:** Tags are session-level, quality scores sparse (3%)
- **Cross-session learning transfer:** No metric for pattern reuse
- **User satisfaction:** Inferred from interruption rate, not measured directly
- **Artifact completeness:** Builds succeed but output may be incomplete (no check for decl.html/decl.hovers.json)

**Most critical gap:** Outcome metrics. The system tracks whether work was done (issues closed, builds passed) but not whether problems were solved (quality improved, tags discriminate, users benefited).

### False Confidence: Metrics That Look Good But Miss Reality

#### 1. 100% Closure Rate (C2, C4)
**What it shows:** All issues from previous cycle were closed
**What it misses:** Quality/tags unmoved despite closing #110, #111, #121
**Why it's misleading:** Closing an issue means code/docs changed, not that the problem was solved

#### 2. 100% Plan Approval
**What it shows:** All plans approved on first attempt
**What it misses:** C3 found agents don't read Known Limitations before planning (2 rejections in MVP session)
**Why it's misleading:** Plans are approved because they sound reasonable, not because they incorporate all constraints

#### 3. 0% Gate Failures
**What it shows:** All builds pass quality gates
**What it misses:** Gates don't check artifact completeness, guidance adoption, or whether features actually work
**Why it's misleading:** Passing gates means no regressions, not that new work is correct

#### 4. Improvement Capture Adoption (3 uses across C4-C5)
**What it shows:** Tool is being used
**What it misses:** Low usage rate (3 in 2 cycles, ~6 sessions) suggests friction or missed opportunities
**Why it's misleading:** Tool existence ≠ tool utility

**Root cause:** Process metrics (did we complete the activity?) dominate outcome metrics (did the activity achieve its purpose?).

### Signal-to-Noise: Are Findings Getting More Actionable Over Time?

| Cycle | Avg Severity | Specificity | Actionability |
|-------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| C1 | Medium | General patterns | High (7/7 addressable) |
| C2 | Medium | Refinements | High (7/7 addressable) |
| C3 | High | Architectural recognition | Medium (5/8 guidance, 3/8 structural) |
| C4 | High | Meta-process | High (3/3 but verification needed) |
| C5 | High | Precision gaps | Medium (2/5 architectural, 3/5 guidance) |

**Trend:** Findings are getting deeper (architectural vs tactical) and more precise (specific anti-patterns vs general "do better").

**Signal quality improving:** Yes. Finding depth progression:
```
C1: "Doing mode detection needs richer signals"
C2: "Exploration agents need task differentiation"
C3: "Observation layer debt is structural, not incremental"
C4: "Guidance accumulates without verification"
C5: "Auto-tags are session-level, not entry-level"
```

**Noise sources:**
- **Unverified guidance additions:** 14/14 guidance items in C2-C4 have unknown adoption
- **Re-logged architectural issues:** #110→#121→#138 for tags (same problem, different issue numbers)
- **Finalization failures:** Noted in 4 cycles but never investigated (signal or noise?)

**Overall assessment:** Signal quality is improving, but action pipeline is bottlenecked on verification and architectural work. High-quality findings accumulate without resolution.

### Assessment: Is the System Observing the Right Things?

**No, with caveats.**

The system observes operational execution well (completion, approvals, gates) but observes outcomes poorly (quality, tags, guidance adoption). This creates Goodhart's Law risk: optimizing process metrics that don't correlate with actual improvement.

**However:** The L2 system has recognized this gap and explicitly logged it:
- #154 (metric verification in finalization)
- #164 (guidance verification protocol)
- #160 (tag granularity for better discrimination)

The observation layer is **observing its own inadequacy**, which is meta-progress. The system knows what it doesn't know.

**Critical next step:** Shift measurement from process (closure, completion) to outcome (quality >30%, tags >0.1, guidance adoption >50%). Block additional L2 cycles until outcome instrumentation exists, otherwise introspection optimizes the wrong target.

## 7. Recommendations for Next L3 Cycle

### A. Implement Outcome Metrics Before Next L2 (Critical)

**Context:** Five L2 cycles have produced 31 issues, 26 closed, but quality/tags unmoved. Process metrics (closure) are misleading.

**Action:** Define measurable outcomes and track alongside process metrics:
- **Quality coverage target:** 80% (currently 3%)
- **Tag signal target:** >0.5 precision/recall (currently 0.0)
- **Guidance adoption target:** >50% (currently ~20%)

**Enforcement:** Block additional L2 cycles if outcome metrics don't improve across 2 cycles. This indicates logging theater (appearance of progress without actual improvement).

**Why this matters:** Without outcome metrics, introspection optimizes the wrong target (closure efficiency vs actual improvement). Current pattern: high closure rates (100%) correlate with zero outcome improvement (quality/tags unchanged).

**Implementation path:** Add outcome tracking to L2 archive phase. Report "Outcome Delta" alongside "Issues Logged/Closed."

---

### B. Execute Architectural Interventions (#143, DuckDB) (Critical)

**Context:** Tags and quality have been "deferred to architectural solutions" for 3+ cycles, but those solutions haven't been implemented.

**Action:** Dedicate focused /task cycles to:
1. **#143:** Quality validator integration in build.py (closed but unverified)
2. **DuckDB schema:** Entry-level tag extraction (#118, #138, #160)
3. **Verification build:** Run a build and confirm quality coverage >30%

**Why this matters:** L2 cycles cannot progress meaningfully while foundational measurement tools are broken. Current pattern (diagnose → log → no change → re-diagnose) is waste.

**Timeline:** Measurement instrumentation blocks meaningful introspection progress. Prioritize this over additional L2 cycles until quality >30% and tags >0.1 signal score.

---

### C. Add Verification Sampling to L2 Discovery (High)

**Context:** ~21 guidance additions, ~4 verified (19% verification rate). Documentation debt compounding.

**Action:** Implement Step 0.5 verification sampling in L2 discovery phase (already defined in SKILL.md but unused in C1-C5):
1. Pick 2-3 prior guidance items (from previous cycles)
2. Search session JSONL files for behavioral evidence
3. Classify as ADOPTED / NOT YET OBSERVED / INEFFECTIVE
4. Escalate items hitting 2-cycle "NOT YET OBSERVED" threshold to INEFFECTIVE
5. Recommend strengthening, removing, or automating ineffective guidance

**Why this matters:** Prevents knowledge base degradation and false confidence. Guidance additions are cheap (add text to SKILL.md); verification is the bottleneck. Without pruning, the system's knowledge base degrades over time.

**Expected outcome:** Verification rate >50% within 2 cycles, ineffective guidance pruned.

---

### D. Investigate Finalization Failure Pattern (Medium)

**Context:** Finalization noted as most common failure substate in C2-C5, never investigated deeper.

**Action:** In next L2 cycle, use `sbs_search_entries` to:
1. Find entries with `substate: "finalization"` and failure signals in `notes`
2. Classify failure modes (context compaction, gate failures, user cancellation, other)
3. Log investigation findings as new issue or update existing #114

**Why this matters:** Four cycles of observation without action suggests this may be measurement artifact (finalization is last phase, so all failures appear here) or accepted background noise. Explicit investigation closes the loop.

**Expected outcome:** Either confirm it's measurement artifact and stop tracking, or identify root cause and address.

---

### E. Track Improvement Capture Adoption Trend (Low)

**Context:** `sbs_improvement_capture` used 3 times across C4-C5. This validates zero-friction capture workflow, but usage rate is low.

**Action:** In next L3 cycle, count improvement captures between L2 cycles. Trend data becomes meaningful after 3+ capture cycles. If usage drops to 0 for 2 consecutive L2 cycles, investigate:
- Is there friction in the capture workflow?
- Are opportunities being missed?
- Is the tool providing value?

**Why this matters:** Improvement captures are early-warning signals for friction that retrospectives miss (observations logged mid-session, not post-session). Low adoption means missed insights.

**Expected outcome:** Usage trend visible (increasing, stable, or declining). If declining, diagnose and fix or deprecate tool.

---

### F. Test Data-Based Hypotheses (Medium)

Given the Data Speaks section, actively test these hypotheses in the next L3 cycle:

#### Hypothesis 1: System Engineering Bias
**Claim:** 48% of issues are System Engineering pillar. Is this because system tooling is genuinely weaker, or because system issues are easier to observe/log than user/alignment issues?

**Test method:** In next L3, classify C6+ issues. If System pillar drops below 30%, the bias was early-stage discovery. If it stays at 45%+, system tooling is genuinely the weakest area.

#### Hypothesis 2: Closure Lag Variance
**Claim:** C2 issues closed in 1 cycle (100%), C1/C3 took 1-2 cycles (71%→100% and 75%→100%). What determines fast vs slow closure?

**Test method:** Correlate closure lag with issue type (code fix, guidance, architectural). Hypothesis: code fixes close faster, architectural issues slower.

#### Hypothesis 3: Verification Bottleneck
**Claim:** 23% verification rate. Is this because guidance is wrong, or because validation opportunities are rare?

**Test method:** For C5 issues, track how many subsequent sessions provide validation opportunities (e.g., #152 explore-before-ask needs alignment-phase sessions). If opportunities exist but verification doesn't happen, guidance is likely ineffective. If opportunities are rare, verification process is sound but slow.

**Why this matters:** Moving from observation to hypothesis testing demonstrates scientific rigor. Counter-evidence strengthens conclusions.

### Summary of Recommendations

| Rec | Priority | Type | Blocks Next L2? |
|-----|----------|------|-----------------|
| A. Outcome metrics | Critical | Process | Yes |
| B. Architectural work (#143, DuckDB) | Critical | Engineering | Yes |
| C. Verification sampling | High | Process | No |
| D. Finalization investigation | Medium | Analysis | No |
| E. Capture adoption trend | Low | Monitoring | No |
| F. Hypothesis testing | Medium | Rigor | No |

**Recommended next actions:**
1. Implement outcome metrics (Rec A) - prerequisite for meaningful L2 cycles
2. Execute architectural interventions (Rec B) - unblocks observation layer
3. Add verification sampling to L2 discovery (Rec C) - reduces documentation debt
4. Defer additional L2 cycles until quality >30% and tags >0.1 (enforcement of Rec A+B)

**Timeline:** Measurement instrumentation (Rec B) blocks meaningful introspection progress. Prioritize architectural work over additional L2 cycles until foundational metrics improve.
