## I. The Central Finding

The introspection system diagnoses faster than it treats. Across 5 L2 cycles and 2 L3 analyses, three structural problems were identified unanimously -- observation layer broken (tags at 0.0 signal), guidance unverified (14% verification rate), finalization failures uninvestigated. None have been fixed. The archive is 92% self-referential (747 skill entries) and 8% product work (77 builds). Quality scores moved +0.11 over 38 hours. The system can see more problems than it can fix.

## II. User Operational Profile (Summary)

Full profile stored at `dev/markdowns/permanent/USER_PROFILE.md`.

**Communication:** High-density bursts. Short, lowercase, often with typos. Terseness signals confidence, not disengagement. Extended responses indicate framing corrections, novel context, or delegation with trust boundaries.

**Decision patterns:**
- 71% clean option picks (fast, unambiguous)
- 50% override of "(Recommended)" tags in favor of broader scope
- 46% select-ALL on multi-select questions
- 97% first-pass plan approval rate
- Delegates architecture/implementation, retains scope/priority/risk

**Leverage points:** Pre-reviewed context that compresses alignment. Single directives resolving multiple ambiguities. Framing corrections that teach lasting preferences. "Fix forward" philosophy.

**Friction points:** Over-engineering during alignment. Per-item confirmations. Internal terminology in user-facing text. Agent spawning during active editing. Questions about already-decided matters.

**Effective taxonomy:** Only 3 of 10 CLAUDE.md headers are regularly used (Scope: 42, Confirm: 27, Approach: 24). 86.9% of headers are ad-hoc one-offs.

## III. CLAUDE.md Gap Analysis

10 rules audited against archive evidence:

| Rule | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Oracle-first mandatory | UNKNOWN | Zero instrumentation to verify |
| Standard header taxonomy | **VIOLATED** | 13.1% compliance (86.9% ad-hoc) |
| Aggressive delegation | Partial | Works during skills; 50% of questions happen outside skills |
| (Recommended) compliance | UNKNOWN | No tracking of recommended-vs-selected |
| Doing mode detection | UNKNOWN | No artifacts, but low interruption rate (4.8%) suggests implicit success |
| Plan size under 10K | UNKNOWN | No character count tracking |
| Proactive bug logging | Partial | Infrastructure exists, utilization unclear |
| Testing at gates | **COMPLIANT** | 0 failures in 31 checks |
| Visual verification mandatory | Partial | 397 visual-change entries, only 3 QA sessions |
| Git push restriction | **COMPLIANT** | 100% archive-first push compliance |

**Pattern:** The two cleanest rules (gates, git push) are enforced by code. The most violated rule (headers) is enforced by nothing. Enforcement through code works; enforcement through instruction doesn't.

## IV. Strange Loops

Four feedback loops analyzed. Three are broken.

### Loop 1: Observation -> Issue -> Fix -> Verification
**Status: BROKEN at verification.** 100% closure rate coexists with 14% verification rate. The system creates fixes faster than it verifies them. This is textbook Goodhart's Law: closure rate optimized from 71% to 100% while verification rate declined from 29% to 0%.

### Loop 2: Gate Failure -> Investigation -> Gate Improvement
**Status: NEVER ACTIVATED.** 0 gate failures because gates test for conditions that don't arise. Gates pass while tasks fail for unrelated reasons (context compaction, finalization ceremony). A dead loop.

### Loop 3: Tag System Recursive Failure
**Status: RECURSIVELY BROKEN.** Tags at 0.0 signal. L2 identifies this. Creates issue. Issue gets closed. Tags remain 0.0. Four issues (#110, #121, #138, #160) across five cycles for the same unfixed problem. The broken instrument is the most observed thing in the system.

### Loop 4: Introspection vs. Engineering
**Status: THE DEEPEST LOOP.** 5 L2 cycles + 2 L3 analyses have produced 31 issues and comprehensive diagnosis. The 3 structural fixes they unanimously recommend remain unexecuted. The system's capacity for self-observation has outpaced its capacity for self-modification. 92% of archive entries are self-referential; 8% are builds.

**Improvement Capture Bypass:** 21 organic observations logged mid-session via `sbs_improvement_capture`. These are the richest, most specific observations in the system. L2's discovery phase "returned 0 findings" despite these existing. The curated signal and the automated analysis are parallel streams that never merge.

## V. Information Architecture

### Quality Trajectory
L1 retrospective quality is NOT monotonically improving -- it is diverging. Complex sessions with friction produce excellent retrospectives (1770156860, 1770160373, 1770241377). Clean sessions produce vacuous ones (20260205172644). The 5-dimension template creates a floor but forces padding where 2 sentences would suffice.

### L1 -> L2 Information Loss
L2 correctly identifies recurring patterns but drops unique architectural insights:
- **Bootstrap problem** (skill modifying its own governing files) -- mentioned once in L1, never surfaces at L2/L3
- **DuckDB + Rich Args reusable pattern** -- architecturally significant, never elevated
- **Adaptation notes concept** -- ephemeral vs. durable knowledge distinction, lost at L2
- **Per-wave archive entries gap** -- relevant to observation layer, never connected

L2 has a persistence bias: it sees what recurs, not what matters once.

### L2 -> L3 Redundancy
Two L3 documents analyze the same 5 L2 cycles and reach 80% identical conclusions. Substantive content compresses to three sentences: "closure isn't resolution, observation instruments are broken, guidance is unverified." The hierarchical structure creates appearance of deeper insight through length, but the delta between L2 and L3 is narrow.

### Improvement Captures Orphaned
21 captures exist in a parallel channel that bypasses the hierarchy entirely. Logged mid-session (not post-session like L1), stored as archive entries (not synthesized like L2), never read by L3 (which only reads L2 summaries). The system's most specific, actionable observations are invisible to its own analysis pipeline.

## VI. Recommendations

Ordered by expected impact.

1. **Pause L2/L3 cycles. Execute the engineering.** The diagnostic phase has yielded everything it can with current instruments. Further introspection without new data produces diminishing returns. Next L2 should follow after: a build exercising quality scoring (#143), DuckDB tag implementation (#160), manual verification of 5 guidance additions.

2. **Merge improvement captures into L2 discovery.** Make `sbs_entries_since_self_improve` include improvement-trigger entries, or create `sbs_improvement_review` tool that surfaces them during discovery.

3. **Expand the effective header taxonomy.** Codify the 3 that work (Scope, Confirm, Approach) and add the 5-7 most common ad-hoc headers. Or drop enforcement entirely and accept organic labeling.

4. **Make retrospective templates adaptive.** For sessions with 0 corrections and 0 redirections, allow compressed retrospective (metrics only). Reserve full 5-section retrospectives for sessions with genuine friction.

5. **Instrument the actually-interesting things.** Oracle-first compliance, question necessity, plan character counts, visual verification before/after -- rules with no observability. Lightweight tags or metrics for these would close the "designed but unmeasured" gap.

6. **For the user:** Your strongest lever is framing corrections. Every redirect ("do not overcomplicate this," "transitioning to end-epoch") becomes a lasting system improvement. The IO shorthand is a good mechanism -- use it more freely when question framing doesn't match your mental model.
