# L3 Meta-Analysis: Session Patterns

## Ingestion Summary
7 findings from cross-session analysis. Key patterns:

### Process Effectiveness
- **Explore-first decomposition** produces high-quality user alignment. The pattern of deep codebase exploration → structured decomposition → user feedback → issue creation was validated this session (user IO: "well researched and thought out").
- **Mid-conversation architectural pivots** are healthy. The shift from original Wave 4-5 structure to Lake-first architecture happened naturally when the user surfaced the "move Dress upstream" insight. The decomposition adapted cleanly.

### Tool Usage Patterns
- **Label validation gap:** Issue creation failed on first attempt due to non-existent labels. Checking `gh label list` before batch creation would prevent this. Low cost, high reliability improvement.
- **Parallel issue creation** works well — 5 issues created per batch with no conflicts.

### Orchestration Health
- Session stayed at orchestrator level throughout (no agent spawning needed for pure planning/scoping work). Correct per CLAUDE.md — orchestrator plans, agents implement.
- IO capture integrated naturally into the workflow without interrupting flow.

### Improvement Opportunities Surfaced
1. Add label validation to `sbs_issue_create` MCP tool (or pre-flight check)
2. The Explore agent provided excellent infrastructure context — consider making "explore before decompose" a standard pattern for `/task` alignment phase
3. AskUserQuestion with Architecture/Scope headers produced efficient decision points
