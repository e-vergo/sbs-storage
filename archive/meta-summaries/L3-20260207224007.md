# L3 Meta-Analysis: Synchronization as Architectural Property\n\nAnalyzed 3 L1 batches (12 task sessions, Feb 5-7 2026). Key finding: synchronization failure across parallel paths is the dominant bug class, manifesting at encoding (#273), rendering (#275), and dependency (B3) levels. This is an emergent architectural property, not independent bugs.\n\nIssue #279 logged for synchronization completeness metric. Synthesis document at dev/storage/archive/meta-summaries/L3-20260208033731.md.\n\n6 recommendations: centralized sanitization (High), field checklist (High), DuckDB fix (High), sync metric (Medium), manifest check (Medium), namespace docs (Low).
