## Retrospectives Reviewed

| Entry ID | Task | Key Observation |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| 1770192056 | /task #155 (wall-clock time optimization) | 8 agents, 3 waves, 856 lines, zero collisions. Auto-tagger flagged clean execution as problematic. Alignment was efficient due to orthogonal questions. |
| 1770193776 | /task crush (8 issues: #156, #153, #154, #152, #150, #142, #146, #143) | Fastest alignment ever for multi-issue task. IO shorthand adopted immediately. `gh` CLI repo inference bug observed. Test simulation anti-pattern identified. |

## Improvement Captures Reviewed

| Entry ID | Category | Observation |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| 1770193719 | tooling | MCP repo tests require project-specific venv; sbs_run_tests can't reach them. |

## Previous Cycle Follow-Up

| Issue | Status | Outcome |
|-------|--------|---------|
| #152 (explore-before-ask) | Closed (crush) | Guidance added to sbs-developer.md. Not yet verified in practice. |
| #153 (serve tool errors) | Closed (crush) | Error field added to ServeResult. Not yet verified via /qa. |
| #154 (metric verification in finalization) | Closed (crush) | Runtime state checks added to SKILL.md. Not yet verified. |
| #142 (e2e test for improvement_capture) | Closed (crush) | 5 tests added, but retrospective notes they are simulation tests, not integration. |
| #143 (quality validators in build.py) | Closed (crush) | Quality validator integration added. No build run since to verify coverage improvement. |

**Closure rate for cycle 4 issues:** 5/5 remaining issues all closed (100% cumulative). However, 0/5 have been verified in subsequent sessions.

**Key finding:** The crush session cleared the entire backlog from cycle 4, but verification remains pending for all items. This extends the guidance verification debt pattern identified in cycle 4.

## Cross-Session Patterns

### Pattern 1: Auto-Tag Uniformity Within Sessions

All 197 v2-era entries carry the same ~20 tags because the auto-tagger computes from session-level metadata (token counts, tool distribution, model). Tags like `signal:retry-loop` appear on clean execution entries because they describe the session aggregate. This has been true for multiple cycles but this is the first time a retrospective explicitly flagged it as misleading ("over-sensitive to normal exploration patterns").

The tag system currently serves as a session classifier, not an entry classifier. This distinction hasn't been articulated before.

### Pattern 2: Crush Mode is a Mature, Reliable Pattern

Two consecutive sessions (#155 feature task, then crush) both executed cleanly with no retries, no collisions, and 100% plan approval. The crush specifically: 8 issues, 5 waves, 8 agents, 0 corrections. The triage-table presentation format enables fast approval. Crush mode has crossed from "experimental" to "standard operating procedure."

### Pattern 3: Guidance Verification Debt is Compounding

| Cycle | Guidance additions | Verified |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| 2 | ~5 | 2 |
| 3 | ~5 | 0 |
| 4 | 3 | 0 |
| 5 (crush closures) | 8 | 0 |
| **Total** | **~21** | **2** |

This is the most concerning cross-session pattern. 90%+ of guidance additions remain unverified. The self-improve cycle creates recommendations, which get closed via code/doc changes, but there's no feedback loop confirming behavioral change. Issue #164 addresses this.

### Pattern 4: Execution Metrics Continue Stable

| Metric | Cycle 3 | Cycle 4 | Cycle 5 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Task completion | 86.7% | 87.2% | 87.8% |
| Backward transitions | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Gate failures | 0/26 | 0/26 | 0/28 |
| Plan approval | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Interruption rate | 2/103 | 2/103 | 2/109 |

All operational metrics are stable or improving slightly. The system is in steady state for execution quality.

## Per-Pillar Synthesis

### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness

**L1 observations:** User continues efficient and decisive. Task #155: 5 orthogonal questions, all answered immediately. Crush: single triage proposal, instant approval. IO shorthand adopted within minutes of documentation.

**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment. 2/109 interruptions (stable). Improvement capture tool used once between cycles.

**Synthesis:** Strongest pillar, unchanged. The IO shorthand adoption is a positive signal that convention documentation matches user mental models. No issues logged for this pillar.

### Pillar 2: Claude Execution

**L1 observations:** Zero-retry execution in both sessions. Auto-tags flagged clean sessions as problematic (false positive signal). Test simulation anti-pattern identified.

**MCP findings:** Task completion 87.8%. Self-improve dialogue phase long (1556s avg) but this cycle used batched review successfully. Finalization remains most common failure substate.

**Synthesis:** Two findings logged: #161 (gh CLI repo inference) and #162 (test simulation pattern). Both are about precision of agent work, not volume. The system executes reliably but produces occasional wrong-target or weak-test outputs.

### Pillar 3: Alignment Patterns

**L1 observations:** 100% plan approval in both sessions. No mid-execution adjustments. Metric verification gap from cycle 4 was addressed (#154 closed) but not yet verified.

**MCP findings:** 33/33 plans reached execution. 0 backward transitions. 2 historical skipped planning phases (not recent).

**Synthesis:** One finding logged: #164 (guidance verification protocol). This is a meta-process improvement — the alignment mechanisms work, but we can't prove it because verification is absent.

### Pillar 4: System Engineering

**L1 observations:** 709/709 evergreen tests pass. MCP repo testing gap identified. Quality validator integration implemented but unverified.

**MCP findings:** Quality score coverage 3.0% (unchanged, but #143 fix hasn't been exercised via build yet). 0 gate failures. Tags still 0.0 signal score uniformly.

**Synthesis:** Two findings logged: #160 (tag uniformity) and #163 (MCP repo test support). Both are observation-layer improvements. The infrastructure itself is reliable; the monitoring/analysis tools need refinement to provide actionable signals.

## Behavioral Observations

### Finding Depth Continues Increasing

| Cycle | Findings | Nature |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | 7 | Surface-level process gaps |
| 2 | 7 | Structural improvements |
| 3 | 8 | Tooling and verification gaps |
| 4 | 3 | Deeper observation (metric verification, error messages) |
| 5 | 5 | Meta-process (verification protocol), precision issues (test quality, tag granularity) |

The findings are shifting from "things that are broken" to "things that appear to work but have subtle quality gaps." This is a healthy maturation trajectory.

### Batched Dialogue Phase Confirmed Effective

This cycle presented all 5 findings in a single batch with one confirmation prompt. Previous cycle experimented with this; user approved without modification, confirming batched review is the preferred approach. Self-improve dialogue avg should decrease in future cycles.

### L2-to-L2 Trend

Cycle 4 recommended tracking this. Updated:

| Cycle | Issues logged | All closed? | Verified? |
|-------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | 7 | Yes | 2/7 |
| 2 | 7 | Yes | Unknown |
| 3 | 8 | Yes (75% by cycle 4, 100% by cycle 5) | ~2/8 |
| 4 | 3 | Yes (closed in crush) | 0/3 |
| 5 | 5 | Pending | N/A |

The closure pipeline is efficient (all issues eventually get closed). The verification pipeline is the bottleneck. Issue #164 is the structural fix.

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

1. **Run a build and check quality coverage.** #143 was implemented; a build should produce quality-scored entries. If coverage jumps, the fix worked. If not, investigate.
2. **Begin guidance verification sampling** per #164. Pick 2-3 additions from cycles 2-3 and check session transcripts for adoption evidence.
3. **Track #161 and #162** — both are agent guidance additions that will themselves need verification. Meta-irony: they add to the verification debt they help address.
4. **Observe tag behavior after #160 is implemented.** If entry-level tags are introduced, re-run tag effectiveness analysis to see if signal scores improve.
5. **L2-to-L2 trend:** Finding count stable (5), finding depth increasing. System is in refinement mode, not emergency mode.
