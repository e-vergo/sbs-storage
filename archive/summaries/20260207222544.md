# L2 Introspection: Batch 2 of 3 (Feb 6 14:15 - Feb 6 21:53)\n\n## Scope\n\n4 task sessions covering the SBS Rewrite Epic (#224) Crushes 1-3 plus a standalone feature:\n1. **Task 5** (Crush 1: Foundation) — #245-249 — SubVerso profiling, Dress audit, Lake integration, incremental validation, statement validator\n2. **Task 6** (Crush 2: Performance + Infoview) — #250-254 — SubVerso optimization, lazy highlighting, infoview fork, RPC wiring, cross-referencing\n3. **Task 7** (Crush 3: Polish + Live Dev) — #255-258 — KaTeX rendering, interactive navigation, watch mode, dev server with live reload\n4. **Task 8** (Above/Below) — #265 — New `above`/`below` fields in `@[blueprint]` attribute across full pipeline\n\n15 issues closed across all 4 sessions.\n\n## Cross-Session Findings\n\n### F1: Parallel Paths Are a Recurring Structural Pattern (ACTIONABLE -> #275)\nBatch #1 found parallel *encoding* paths in artifacts (#273). This batch found parallel *rendering* paths in Runway. Task 8 initially missed the Traverse pipeline path when adding `above`/`below` fields, requiring a fix wave to add 6 more files. The SBS pipeline structurally has multiple parallel paths (encoding, rendering, and potentially more) that must stay synchronized. This is an emergent architectural property worth documenting.\n\n### F2: Background Agent Spawning Causes Dead Time (ACTIONABLE -> #276)\nTask 6 used `run_in_background=true` for agent spawning, which broke orchestrator synchronization. The fix (block-wait) was discovered mid-session and two improvement observations were logged. This was corrected in subsequent sessions but enforcement is convention-only.\n\n### F3: Crush-Based Execution Is Highly Productive (POSITIVE)\nTasks 5-7 executed three \"crushes\" of 4-5 issues each in rapid succession (~6 hours total for 14 issues). Each crush used structured wave parallelism (2-3 agents, non-overlapping files). The pattern works because the Epic scoping session (pre-batch, task 4) had already decomposed work into independent tracks with explicit dependency ordering.\n\n### F4: Validation Gates Catch Real Gaps (POSITIVE, echoes Batch #1 F1)\nTask 8's end-to-end validation caught the missing Traverse pipeline path. This directly echoes Batch #1's finding that at-scale validation catches bugs invisible at test scale. The gate caught a class of bug (missing parallel path) that surface-level code review would miss.\n\n### F5: RPC Namespace Bug Pre-existed From Crush 2 (OBSERVATION)\nThe epoch retrospective noted a pre-existing RPC double-namespace bug (`Architect.Architect.blueprintInfo` instead of `Architect.blueprintInfo`) from Crush 2 (#253). This was discovered and fixed during Task 8, not during Crush 2 itself. Cross-session bugs that survive their originating session suggest the validation gate should include RPC endpoint verification.\n\n### F6: Label Validation Gap Persists (#260 still open) (OBSERVATION)\nIssue creation in the logging phase of this introspection itself hit the label validation error. The same pattern was noted in Batch #1 as \"already tracked\" (#260). Still open, still causing friction.\n\n## Comparison with Batch #1\n\n| Pattern | Batch #1 | Batch #2 |\n|---------|----------|----------|\n| Parallel paths needing sync | Encoding paths (#273) | Rendering paths (#275) |\n| Validation catching real bugs | Scale-dependent (SBS-Test vs PNT) | Path-dependent (AST vs Traverse) |\n| Label validation friction | Noted, filed #260 | Hit again during introspection |\n| Implement-small-verify-large | Validated | Reinforced |\n| New pattern | Threshold-based testing (#274) | Crush-based execution productivity |\n| New pattern | — | Background agent anti-pattern (#276) |\n\n## Issues Filed\n- **#275**: Dual rendering paths in Runway require synchronized updates\n- **#276**: Enforce block-wait pattern for agent spawning\n\n## Issues Already Tracked\n- **#260**: Label pre-validation (hit again this batch)\n- **#273**: Parallel encoding paths (same class as #275)\n- **#264**: Post-crush test suite update\n\n## Metrics\n- Sessions analyzed: 4\n- Issues delivered in batch: 15 (all closed)\n- Findings: 6 (2 actionable, 2 positive, 2 observations)\n- Issues created: 2 (#275, #276)\n- Pattern continuity with Batch #1: 3 echoed patterns, 2 new patterns"
