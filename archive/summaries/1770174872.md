## Retrospectives Reviewed

| Entry ID | Task | Key Observation |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| 1770170870 | MVP expansion (#68, #109) -- 4 waves, 8 agents | Exploration redundancy (4 agents confirming same CSS), dead code detection gap (renderBadge never called) |
| 1770174216 | Backlog triage -- 14 issues, 3 waves, 6 agents | MCP module caching divergence, compressed finalization validated, triage wave structure effective |

## Previous Cycle Follow-Up

| Issue | Status | Outcome |
|-------|--------|---------|
| #110 (tag discrimination) | Closed | Per-session scoping added, but tag analysis still shows 0 signal. Root problem unresolved. |
| #111 (quality scores 3.2%) | Open | Investigated during triage, deferred -- needs build-time integration |
| #112 (simplicity-matching) | Closed | Guidance added. No over-engineering in 2 subsequent sessions. |
| #113 (doing mode detection) | Closed | Detection rules expanded |
| #114 (task incompletion 15%) | Open | Task completion now 85.7% (up from 85%) |
| #115 (T6 threshold) | Closed | Threshold corrected from 0.95 to 0.90 |
| #116 (verbose finalization) | Closed | Compressed finalization implemented and immediately validated |

**Closure rate:** 5/7 (71%). Two remaining issues (#111, #114) are investigations requiring deeper work.

## Cross-Session Patterns

### Pattern 1: Observation Layer Remains the Weakest Link

Despite closing #110, the tag system still produces zero discriminatory signal. All 83 tags have signal_score 0.0. The per-session scoping fix prevented cross-session leakage but didn't address the fundamental problem: rules fire uniformly across all sessions. Quality score coverage remains at 3.2%. The system works reliably but cannot measure how well it works. This was the top finding in L2 cycle 1 and remains the top finding in cycle 2.

**Trend:** Persistent. Two cycles, same core issue. #121 reopens this with a focus on rule discrimination rather than scope leakage.

### Pattern 2: Parallel Agent Coordination Maturing but Has Blind Spots

The MVP session (8 agents, 4 waves) and triage session (6 agents, 3 waves) both executed cleanly with zero file collisions and no backward transitions. Parallelism mechanics are solid. However, exploration-phase parallelism has a quality gap: multiple agents independently confirm the same fact instead of dividing investigation dimensions.

**Trend:** New finding. Not visible in cycle 1 because previous sessions used fewer exploration agents.

### Pattern 3: Tool Trust Requires Qualification

The MCP module caching issue (retrospective 1770174216) introduced a new category of system friction: tool output diverging from ground truth due to stale process state. This is distinct from previous tool issues (missing capabilities, wrong thresholds) -- it's a reliability hazard where the tool appears to work but returns stale data.

**Trend:** New finding. Specific to sessions where Python source is edited and then validated via MCP.

### Pattern 4: Meta-Recursion Accelerates Improvement

The triage session (#120) implemented fixes from the previous self-improve cycle (#112, #113, #115, #116) and immediately validated two of them within the same session. #116 (compressed finalization) was used successfully at the session's end. This demonstrates a healthy feedback loop where self-improve findings translate to actionable fixes that are exercised in subsequent sessions.

## Per-Pillar Synthesis

### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness

**L1 observations:** User continues to be decisive and efficient. Compressed finalization (#116) validated. Triage alignment: 0.2 questions per issue. Visual review during planning surfaces concrete requirements.

**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment (<=2 entries). 85 issue-driven, 78 freeform tasks. 1 interruption in 90 sessions.

**Synthesis:** User interaction is stable and efficient. The main improvement opportunity is structural: documenting triage wave patterns (#127) so future sessions benefit from the efficient structure observed in 1770174216. No regressions from cycle 1.

### Pillar 2: Claude Execution

**L1 observations:** Exploration redundancy (4 agents on same question). Dead code missed by surface-level checks. Feature removal requires test cleanup as recurring pattern. 2 agents per wave is the sweet spot.

**MCP findings:** Task completion 85.7% (up from 85%). 0 backward transitions. 2 planning phases skipped in 42 tasks. Finalization remains most common failure substate.

**Synthesis:** Execution quality is high but three process gaps identified: (1) exploration agents need task differentiation (#122), (2) call-chain tracing needed for feature correctness (#124), (3) feature removal plans should auto-include test cleanup (#125). All three are guidance additions, not tooling changes.

### Pillar 3: Alignment Patterns

**L1 observations:** 30/30 plans approved (up from 29/29). Mid-planning scope additions are healthy when small/concrete. No over-engineering in either session (suggesting #112 fix worked).

**MCP findings:** 100% plan approval, 0 backward transitions, 0 rejected plans.

**Synthesis:** Alignment is the strongest pillar. The #112 simplicity-matching guidance appears effective -- no over-engineering in 2 sessions since the fix. No new issues logged for this pillar. Maintaining current trajectory.

### Pillar 4: System Engineering

**L1 observations:** MCP module caching causes validation divergence. T6 threshold fixed. Per-session tag scoping added but tags still don't discriminate. `sbs_question_stats` still broken.

**MCP findings:** 0/25 gate failures. Quality score coverage 3.2%. All tags signal_score 0.0. 19 legacy tags in archive.

**Synthesis:** Infrastructure reliability (builds, gates, PRs, handoffs) remains solid: 0 gate failures in 25 checks. The observation layer is still broken: tags don't discriminate (#121), quality scores are sparse (#111), and a key analysis tool is broken (#126). Added a new finding: MCP module caching (#123) is a reliability hazard for same-session validation.

## Behavioral Observations

### Improvement Velocity

The 5/7 closure rate from cycle 1 is strong. Of the 5 closed issues, 2 were validated in subsequent sessions (#112 simplicity-matching, #116 compressed finalization). This demonstrates that the self-improve -> issue -> fix -> validate loop works.

### Finding Categories Shifting

Cycle 1 findings were discovery-oriented ("we don't know X", "we can't measure Y"). Cycle 2 findings are refinement-oriented ("the fix for X didn't go far enough", "process Y needs a specific improvement"). This is a healthy maturation pattern -- the system is moving from "identify problems" to "refine solutions."

### Observation Layer Debt

Two cycles in a row, the observation layer (tags, quality scores, question stats) is the weakest area. This debt compounds: without discriminating tags and quality scores, the self-improve cycle itself has less data to work with. Breaking this cycle requires either fixing the observation tools or accepting that the current analysis relies primarily on retrospective narratives (L1 documents) rather than automated metrics.

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

1. **Check if #121 (tag discrimination) produces actual signal.** This is now the third cycle where tags are flagged. If the next fix doesn't produce discriminating tags, consider whether the auto-tagging approach itself is the wrong abstraction.
2. **Validate #122 and #124 (exploration guidance).** These are process/guidance fixes. Check if subsequent sessions show differentiated exploration agents and call-chain tracing.
3. **Monitor #123 (MCP caching).** If the fix is module reload, verify it doesn't break MCP server performance.
4. **Check #126 (question_stats).** Three cycles of this being broken is too long. Prioritize the datetime fix.
5. **Compare against cycle 1 baseline:** Task completion 85% -> 85.7% (modest improvement). Plans still 100%. Quality coverage still 3.2% (no improvement -- #111 unresolved). Tag signal still 0.0 (no improvement -- #110 fix insufficient).
6. **L2-to-L2 trend:** Cycle 1 logged 7 issues, cycle 2 logged 7 issues. Closure rate of cycle 1 findings was 71%. If cycle 2 maintains similar closure rate, approximately 5 of these 7 should be resolved before cycle 3.
