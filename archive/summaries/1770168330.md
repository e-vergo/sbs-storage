## Retrospectives Reviewed

| Entry ID | Task | Key Observation |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| 1770156860 | Agent State Taxonomy (10 issues, 3 waves) | Zero corrections, 100% pre-offered option selection, user favors comprehensive scope |
| 1770160373 | Sidebar Highlight Contrast | Doing mode detection failure -- user editing in VSCode, orchestrator spawned agent |
| 1770161268 | Parallel Agent Config | Exemplary efficiency -- single directive covered all alignment |
| 1770163188 | Sidebar Overhaul | Over-engineering toggle mechanism, two user redirections ("do not overcomplicate") |
| 1770165147 | MCP Issue Logging + Multi-agent | MCP tool availability lag, 4-agent parallelism validated for config-only changes |

## Cross-Session Patterns

### Pattern 1: User Communication Is Direct and Decisive

Across all 5 sessions, the user answered alignment questions decisively with zero hesitation. In the taxonomy session, 13/15 questions used pre-offered options; 2 used "Other" when pre-offered options didn't capture a nuance. In the config session, a single directive sufficed for the entire task. The user consistently favors the most comprehensive/ambitious option and communicates at high velocity.

**Implication:** Alignment questions are well-calibrated. The "Other" escape hatch works as designed. Verbosity in confirmations is friction, not thoroughness.

### Pattern 2: Simplicity Signals Are Strong Directives

In 2 of 5 sessions (40%), the user redirected Claude away from over-engineering. The pattern: user references an existing implementation -> Claude proposes alternatives -> user says "match the existing one." This is a systematic tendency, not a one-off.

**Implication:** Claude's design exploration instinct conflicts with user's "match proven patterns" preference. This needs explicit counterprogramming in agent guidance.

### Pattern 3: Agent Spawn Decision Needs Mode Awareness

Session 1770160373 showed the orchestrator offering agent spawn when the user was in "doing mode" (editing directly in VSCode). The existing rule (3+ Bash calls) wasn't sufficient -- the user's mode was signaled by direct file edits, not bash commands.

**Implication:** Doing mode detection needs richer signals beyond bash call count.

### Pattern 4: System Infrastructure Works but Doesn't Observe Itself

All 5 sessions had clean builds, clean gate checks, successful PR workflows, and atomic skill handoffs. The infrastructure is reliable. However, the observation layer (tags, quality scores) is broken -- tags don't discriminate and quality scores cover only 3% of entries. The system works but can't measure how well it works.

## Per-Pillar Synthesis

### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness

**L1 observations:** User communication is efficient, alignment questions work well, finalization can be faster. Doing mode detection failed once.

**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment (<=2 entries), 81 issue-driven vs 74 freeform tasks. No interruptions in 84/85 sessions.

**Synthesis:** The user-facing interaction model is mature. The remaining friction is at the margins: verbose finalization confirmations and a single doing mode detection failure. Two issues logged (#113 doing mode, #116 verbose finalization).

### Pillar 2: Claude Execution

**L1 observations:** 100% plan approval rate, zero backward transitions. One session (taxonomy) executed 13 commits across 3 waves with zero regressions. Execution quality is high when aligned.

**MCP findings:** 85% task completion rate. Finalization is the most common failure substate. 2 planning phases skipped.

**Synthesis:** Execution quality is strong but completion rate has room to improve. The 15% incompletion likely stems from context compaction in long sessions disrupting the finalization ceremony. One investigation issue logged (#114).

### Pillar 3: Alignment Patterns

**L1 observations:** Over-engineering in 2/5 sessions when user had clear pattern reference. 100% plan approval on first presentation.

**MCP findings:** 29/29 plans reached execution (100% approval). Zero backward transitions.

**Synthesis:** Alignment succeeds structurally (plans always approved) but Claude's tendency to explore design space creates friction when the user wants simplicity matching. One issue logged (#112).

### Pillar 4: System Engineering

**L1 observations:** T6 threshold discrepancy (91.4% scored as failed despite 90% gate). MCP tool availability lag after adding new tools. Build and submodule workflows are reliable.

**MCP findings:** 3.1% quality score coverage. Legacy tags fire on 73% of entries with zero signal. v2 tags are uniform at 13.9%. Zero gate failures in 24 checks.

**Synthesis:** The system infrastructure (builds, gates, PRs, handoffs) is reliable. The observation/measurement layer is not -- tags don't discriminate, quality scores are sparse, and validator thresholds don't match plan expectations. Three issues logged (#110 tags, #111 quality coverage, #115 T6 threshold).

## Behavioral Observations

### User Style Evolution

The 5 sessions span a progression from infrastructure-heavy work (taxonomy, 10 issues) to focused UI changes (sidebar) to meta-config changes (parallelism rules) to tooling additions (MCP tools). The user's communication style is consistent across all types: direct, decisive, favoring comprehensive options. No evolution observed -- the style is stable.

### Recurring Alignment Gap

The "over-engineering vs simplicity" tension appeared in 2 non-adjacent sessions (1770160373 and 1770163188). This is not random -- it's a systematic tendency where Claude's "explore the design space" instinct conflicts with the user's "match existing patterns" preference. This is the single most important behavioral finding.

### Tool Usage Trend

The 5 sessions show increasing sophistication in orchestration:
1. Session 1: 3 explore agents -> 1 plan agent -> 3 execution waves
2. Session 2: alignment -> user edits directly (agent rejected)
3. Session 3: minimal alignment -> single agent
4. Session 4: alignment with redirections -> single agent
5. Session 5: 2-wave plan with 4 parallel agents in Wave 2

The progression shows the system learning to match complexity to task scope.

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

1. **Check if #110 (tag discrimination) has been fixed.** This is the highest-leverage fix -- without discriminating tags, the entire analysis layer operates on noise.
2. **Validate quality score coverage** after #111 is addressed. The analysis tools need quality data to surface Pillar 2 and Pillar 4 findings.
3. **Monitor simplicity-matching** (#112) in sessions between now and next cycle. Did the guidance change behavior?
4. **Run `sbs_question_stats`** after the datetime comparison bug is fixed -- question pattern analysis is currently blocked.
5. **First L2 baseline:** This summary establishes the baseline. Future L2 summaries should compare against these findings to measure improvement trajectory.
