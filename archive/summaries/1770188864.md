## Retrospectives Reviewed

| Entry ID | Task | Key Observation |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| 1770185443 | /task #144 (QA skill + browser tools) | Exploration-before-questions principle crystallized: agent asked about Chrome MCP instead of checking .mcp.json. User explicitly corrected. 2 parallel agents, zero retries. |
| 1770188134 | /task crush (7 issues: #136-141, #147) | Cleanest crush session yet. 4 agents across 2 waves, zero retries, zero corrections. Documentation-first wave ordering validated. |

## Improvement Captures Reviewed

| Entry ID | Category | Observation |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| 1770184492 | interaction | Exploration should precede user questions during alignment. Check config/state before asking. |
| 1770187075 | tooling | sbs_serve_project returns {running: false} without error details. QA skill needed manual fallback. |

## Previous Cycle Follow-Up

| Issue | Status | Outcome |
|-------|--------|---------|
| #136 (pre-flight checklist) | Closed (crush) | Guidance added to SKILL.md. No post-closure /task session to verify yet. |
| #137 (consult docs before coding) | Closed (crush) | Guidance added to sbs-developer.md. No post-closure session to verify. |
| #138 (defer auto-tagger to DuckDB) | Closed (crush) | Policy decision. Tags still 0.0 signal score; DuckDB path acknowledged. |
| #139 (quantitative success criteria) | Closed (crush) | Guidance added. No post-closure session to verify. |
| #140 (taxonomy test reminder) | Closed (crush) | Guidance added. No post-closure session to verify. |
| #141 (self-improve entry search fix) | Closed (crush) | Code fix applied. Tool now returns correct entries. |
| #143 (quality validators in build.py) | Still open | Quality coverage still 3.1%. 4th cycle unchanged. |
| #142 (e2e test for improvement_capture) | Still open | Tool actively used (2 captures between cycles), but no formal test. |

**Closure rate for cycle 3 issues:** 6/8 closed (75%). 2 remaining (#142, #143) are implementation work, not guidance updates.

**Key finding:** 6 of 8 issues from the previous cycle were guidance additions closed in a single crush session. These are easy to close but hard to verify -- they require subsequent sessions to demonstrate behavioral change. None of the 6 have been verified yet because the crush session was the most recent /task invocation.

## Cross-Session Patterns

### Pattern 1: Guidance Additions Accumulate Without Verification

Cycles 2-4 have produced 14 guidance additions to SKILL.md and agent files. Only 2 have been verified (the crush triage pattern from #127, and the exploration-then-plan pattern from general observation). The rest are assumed effective because they were closed.

This is the same "closure != resolution" pattern identified in cycle 3, but applied to process guidance rather than metrics. Adding words to a SKILL.md doesn't guarantee agents read and follow them -- the same failure mode that prompted #136 (agents not reading Known Limitations).

### Pattern 2: Improvement Captures Are Working

Two `sbs_improvement_capture` entries were created between cycles, both containing actionable observations that fed directly into this cycle's findings. This validates the zero-friction capture workflow introduced in cycle 3. The tool is being used as intended.

### Pattern 3: Execution Quality Continues Upward Trend

| Metric | Cycle 2 | Cycle 3 | Cycle 4 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Task completion | 85.7% | 86.7% | 87.2% |
| Backward transitions | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Gate failures | 0/22 | 0/26 | 0/26 |
| Plan approval | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Interruption rate | 1/97 | 2/103 | 2/103 |

The crush session (#7 issues, 4 agents, 0 retries) and QA skill session (#144, 2 agents, 0 retries) both show clean execution. The process is maturing.

### Pattern 4: Persistent Metrics Remain Unmoved

Quality score coverage: 3.1% (cycles 1-4, unchanged). Tag signal scores: 0.0 (cycles 1-4, unchanged). Both have been acknowledged as architectural problems requiring structural solutions (#143 for quality, DuckDB for tags). Until those are implemented, these metrics will remain static.

## Per-Pillar Synthesis

### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness

**L1 observations:** User continues efficient and decisive. Crush alignment: single triage proposal, single approval. QA session: 3 questions total. Two improvement captures demonstrate active engagement with the observation system.

**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment. 2/103 interruptions (one correction keyword in QA notes). sbs_improvement_capture actively used.

**Synthesis:** User interaction remains the strongest pillar. The explore-before-ask principle (#152) addresses the one identified friction point. No regression in communication effectiveness.

### Pillar 2: Claude Execution

**L1 observations:** Zero-retry execution in both sessions reviewed. Crush mode is a mature pattern. 4-agent parallel waves executed without collision.

**MCP findings:** Task completion 87.2% (up from 86.7%). Finalization remains most common failure substate. Self-improve dialogue phase is disproportionately long (1688.9s avg) but not critical.

**Synthesis:** Execution quality is the best it's been. The dialogue phase length (noted but not logged) is a natural consequence of interactive refinement and may not need fixing. If it becomes a bottleneck, batching findings could help.

### Pillar 3: Alignment Patterns

**L1 observations:** 100% plan approval across both sessions. No mid-execution redirections. Metric verification gap identified as persistent.

**MCP findings:** 31/31 plans reached execution. 0 backward transitions. 2 skipped planning phases historically (not in recent sessions).

**Synthesis:** Alignment is strong operationally but weak on verification. #154 (metric verification in finalization) addresses the systemic gap between "code merged" and "problem solved."

### Pillar 4: System Engineering

**L1 observations:** sbs_serve_project error handling inadequate. sbs-lsp-mcp tool count grew to 67 (docs say 62). Build infrastructure reliable.

**MCP findings:** 0 gate failures. Quality coverage 3.1% (#143 still open). Tags 0.0 signal (deferred to DuckDB). Overall health: "healthy."

**Synthesis:** Infrastructure reliability remains solid. Two tooling gaps addressed: #153 (serve tool errors) and the persistent #143 (quality score integration). The observation layer debt continues but is now architecturally redirected.

## Behavioral Observations

### Guidance Verification Debt

The project has accumulated ~14 unverified guidance additions across cycles 2-4. This is a new form of debt: we're writing process improvements into SKILL.md and agent files faster than we can verify they work. The next cycle should prioritize verification over new findings.

### Cycle Efficiency Improving

This cycle completed with 4 findings discovered, 3 selected, 3 logged. Previous cycles: 7, 7, 8 findings respectively. Fewer findings per cycle suggests the system is stabilizing -- there are fewer novel problems to discover. The findings that remain are deeper (metric verification, tooling error messages) rather than surface-level.

### Self-Improve Dialogue Phase

At 1688.9s average, this phase dominates the skill's runtime. This cycle deliberately kept dialogue minimal (single confirmation for all 3 findings) to test whether batched review is viable. If the user found this effective, future cycles should default to batched review.

## Findings Logged

| # | Issue | Pillar | Impact |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| #152 | Codify explore-before-ask for runtime/config state | User Effectiveness | High |
| #153 | sbs_serve_project returns unhelpful errors | System Engineering | High |
| #154 | Add metric verification to /task finalization | Alignment Patterns | High |

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

1. **Verify guidance additions.** 14 unverified guidance changes have accumulated. Check whether subsequent sessions demonstrate the prescribed behaviors (explore-before-ask, pre-flight checklist, documentation consultation, quantitative probing).
2. **Track #143 and #153.** Both are implementation work. If #143 is implemented, quality coverage should jump measurably. If #153 is implemented, /qa should no longer need Bash server fallback.
3. **Verify #154 in practice.** Does the metric verification step in /task finalization actually prevent premature issue closure? This is the highest-leverage process improvement from this cycle.
4. **Observe improvement capture usage.** Two captures between cycles 3 and 4. Trend data will be meaningful after 2-3 more cycles.
5. **L2-to-L2 trend:** Cycle 1: 7 issues. Cycle 2: 7 issues (100% closure). Cycle 3: 8 issues (75% closure so far). Cycle 4: 3 issues. Finding count decreasing, finding depth increasing. System stabilizing.
