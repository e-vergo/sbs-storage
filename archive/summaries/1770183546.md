## Retrospectives Reviewed

| Entry ID | Task | Key Observation |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| 1770178263 | MVP Test Suite Expansion (#119) -- 102 new tests, 3 waves | 2 plan rejections from not reading Known Limitations (Verso pages), 13 test failures from undocumented ID normalization assumptions |
| 1770180967 | Batch Issue Crush (10 issues) -- 5 waves, 7 agents, 0 retries | Cleanest session to date. Triage-by-actionability compressed alignment to 3 questions. Zero user interventions during execution. |
| 1770182650 | /task #133 #134 -- 2 parallel agents, 0 retries | Dual archive write paths created (full pipeline vs direct JSONL). Taxonomy test coupling flagged as recurring maintenance. |

## Previous Cycle Follow-Up

| Issue | Status | Outcome |
|-------|--------|---------|
| #121 (tag discrimination) | Closed | Rules redesigned, but ALL tags still signal_score 0.0. Third cycle with same result. Approach deferred to DuckDB (#118, #138). |
| #122 (exploration differentiation) | Closed | Guidance added. Not directly tested in subsequent sessions (no multi-agent exploration in the 3 sessions reviewed). |
| #123 (MCP module caching) | Closed | Fixed with importlib.reload(). No recurrence in subsequent sessions. |
| #124 (call-chain tracing) | Closed | Guidance added. Dead code detection not tested in subsequent sessions. |
| #125 (test cleanup on removal) | Closed | Guidance added. No feature removals in subsequent sessions to validate. |
| #126 (question_stats datetime) | Closed | Fixed. Tool now returns 544 questions across 81 sessions. Fully functional. |
| #127 (triage wave structure) | Closed | Guidance added and immediately validated in crush session (1770180967). |

**Closure rate:** 7/7 (100%, up from 71% in cycle 1).

**Key finding:** High closure rate does not guarantee metric improvement. #121 and #111 were closed but their target metrics (tag discrimination, quality coverage) show zero improvement. Issue closure tracked code changes; downstream metric verification was missing.

---

## Cross-Session Patterns

### Pattern 1: Issue Closure != Problem Resolution

The most important meta-observation of this cycle. Both persistent findings (tags, quality scores) had issues closed in the crush session, but the underlying metrics didn't change. The crush session closed #121 with rule redesign and #111 with investigation findings, but:
- Tags: Still ALL at signal_score 0.0 (3rd consecutive cycle)
- Quality coverage: Still at 3.1% (3rd consecutive cycle)

**Root cause:** Issues were closed based on code changes expected to fix the problem. No verification step confirmed the metric actually improved post-closure. This is a systemic gap in the issue lifecycle.

**Action taken:** For tags, deferred to DuckDB (#118, #138). For quality scores, proposed build pipeline integration (#143) instead of standalone tooling.

### Pattern 2: Execution Quality Continues to Improve

The crush session (10 issues, 5 waves, 7 agents, 0 retries) is the cleanest execution observed. Combined with the #133/#134 session (2 issues, parallel agents, 0 retries), execution quality is trending strongly positive:
- Task completion: 85% -> 85.7% -> 86.7%
- Backward transitions: 0 (stable across all 3 cycles)
- Gate failures: 0/26 (stable)
- Plan approval: 31/31 (100%)

The exploration-then-plan pattern is now validated across multiple session types (single-issue, multi-issue crush, feature implementation).

### Pattern 3: Known Documentation Not Consulted

The MVP session (retrospective 1770178263) revealed a new failure mode: agents not consulting existing documentation before planning/executing. Two instances:
1. Known Limitations (Verso pages removed) -- in CLAUDE.md, not read before planning
2. ID Normalization rules -- in sbs-developer.md, not applied during test writing

This is distinct from the "simplicity matching" pattern identified in cycle 1. That was about design preference; this is about factual constraints that are documented but not consulted. Two new issues (#136, #137) address this.

### Pattern 4: Observation Layer Debt Is Structural, Not Incremental

Three cycles of incremental fixes to the observation layer (tags, quality scores) have produced zero improvement in the metrics that matter. The conclusion: the observation layer's problems are architectural, not implementational:
- Tags: Rule-based classification is the wrong abstraction for session characterization. DuckDB (#118) will bypass this entirely.
- Quality scores: Standalone tooling is the wrong delivery mechanism. Build pipeline integration (#143) addresses the root cause.

This cycle explicitly acknowledges that further incremental tag fixes are futile and redirects effort to the DuckDB path.

## Per-Pillar Synthesis

### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness

**L1 observations:** User continues to be direct and decisive. Crush session alignment: 3 questions for 10 issues. #133/#134 session: 5 questions for 2 design-heavy issues. Zero mid-execution interruptions across all 3 sessions.

**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment (<=2 entries). 1 interruption in 97 sessions. `sbs_question_stats` now working: 544 questions, 81 sessions with questions, user overwhelmingly selects pre-offered options.

**Synthesis:** User interaction remains the strongest pillar. The question_stats data (now accessible) confirms the multiple-choice format works well. No regressions. One new finding: quantitative expectations should be probed during alignment (#139).

### Pillar 2: Claude Execution

**L1 observations:** Zero-retry execution in the crush session (first ever for a 10-issue task). Taxonomy test coupling as recurring maintenance burden. ID normalization knowledge not applied despite being documented.

**MCP findings:** Task completion 86.7% (up from 85.7%). 0 backward transitions. Finalization remains most common failure substate. 2 planning phases skipped in 45 tasks.

**Synthesis:** Execution quality is improving. The zero-retry crush session validates the exploration-then-plan pattern. Two process gaps identified: (1) agents don't consult subsystem documentation before writing code (#137), (2) plan templates miss taxonomy test updates (#140). Both are guidance additions.

### Pillar 3: Alignment Patterns

**L1 observations:** 2 plan rejections in MVP session (from not reading Known Limitations), but 100% approval on first attempt in the other 2 sessions. Quantitative expectations not probed.

**MCP findings:** 31/31 plans reached execution (100% approval). 0 backward transitions.

**Synthesis:** Alignment is strong overall but has a specific blind spot: agents don't incorporate project constraints from documentation before planning. The pre-flight checklist (#136) and quantitative probing (#139) address this. The 2 rejections in the MVP session are an outlier caused by a specific, fixable gap.

### Pillar 4: System Engineering

**L1 observations:** Dual archive write paths created (sbs_improvement_capture). sbs_entries_since_self_improve returns current session's entry. sbs_question_stats now working.

**MCP findings:** 0/26 gate failures. Quality score coverage 3.1%. All tags signal_score 0.0. 19 legacy tags. Overall health: "healthy."

**Synthesis:** Infrastructure reliability (builds, gates, PRs, handoffs) remains solid. The observation layer debt is now explicitly acknowledged as structural and redirected to architectural solutions (DuckDB for tags, build pipeline for quality scores). Two new tooling bugs identified: sbs_entries_since_self_improve boundary detection (#141), sbs_improvement_capture needs e2e test (#142).

---

## Behavioral Observations

### Improvement Velocity Accelerating

Cycle 1: 7 issues, 71% closure rate. Cycle 2: 7 issues, 100% closure rate. Cycle 3: 8 issues logged. If the 100% closure trend continues, all 8 should be resolved before cycle 4.

### Finding Categories Maturing

- Cycle 1: Discovery-oriented ("we don't know X", "we can't measure Y")
- Cycle 2: Refinement-oriented ("the fix for X didn't go far enough")
- Cycle 3: Architectural recognition ("incremental fixes don't work for X, need structural change")

This is a healthy progression. The system is learning to distinguish between implementational problems (fixable with code changes) and architectural problems (requiring redesign).

### Observation Layer Decision Point

The explicit decision to defer tags to DuckDB and redirect quality scores to the build pipeline marks a shift from "fix what exists" to "replace what doesn't work." This is the right call after 3 cycles of evidence, but it means the observation layer will remain weak until #118 and #143 are implemented.

### sbs_improvement_capture Validated

The new tool was used during this session (entry 1770183043) to capture the `sbs_entries_since_self_improve` bug in real-time. This validates the zero-friction capture workflow. Full e2e test coverage still needed (#142).

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

1. **Verify #136 and #137 (documentation consultation).** These are the highest-leverage guidance fixes. Check if subsequent sessions show agents reading Known Limitations and subsystem docs before planning/executing.
2. **Track #118 (DuckDB) progress.** This is now the designated fix path for the persistent tag discrimination problem. If #118 hasn't been started by cycle 4, consider whether the architectural direction needs revision.
3. **Verify #143 (build pipeline quality scores).** After implementation, quality score coverage should jump significantly. If it doesn't, the integration point needs debugging.
4. **Check sbs_improvement_capture usage.** Were any improvement observations captured between cycles? This tool's value is in the data it collects, not in its existence.
5. **Issue closure verification.** This cycle identified that closing issues doesn't guarantee metric improvement. Consider adding a "metric verification" step to the /task finalization phase: after closing issues that reference specific metrics, verify the metric actually changed.
6. **L2-to-L2 trend:** Cycle 1: 7 issues. Cycle 2: 7 issues (100% cycle-1 closure). Cycle 3: 8 issues. Closure rate improving (71% -> 100%). Finding categories shifting from discovery to architectural recognition. Observation layer debt explicitly acknowledged and redirected.
