# L2 Introspection: Batch 1 of 3 (Feb 5 23:43 - Feb 6 14:15)\n\n## Scope\n\n4 task sessions covering work on SBSMonorepo:\n1. Toggle Removal + SBS Alignment (#230)\n2. Unified TeX/Lean Model - Phase 2 (#224)\n3. PNT Delimiter Conversion & Rendering Fix\n4. Epic #224 Waves 4-7 Scoping\n\n## Cross-Session Findings\n\n### F1: At-Scale Validation Catches Bugs Invisible at Test Scale (POSITIVE)\nSessions 2 and 3 formed a natural implement-then-deploy pair. Delimiter support was built in SBS-Test (33 nodes), then deployed to PNT (477 declarations). This immediately revealed the delimiter leakage bug -- SubVerso captures preceding comments in declaration source ranges, causing raw delimiter syntax to appear in output. The bug was invisible at SBS-Test scale. **Pattern validated: implement small, verify at scale.**\n\n### F2: CSS Layout Fixes Hit Structural Limits (OBSERVATION)\nSession 1 solved declaration alignment via padding-top but could not solve proof body alignment because the SBS grid structure prevents content-dependent vertical alignment. Filed #244 for structural grid restructure. Pattern: \"fix what you can, file what needs architecture\" is healthy but creates a backlog of deferred structural work.\n\n### F3: Rendering Pipeline Has Parallel Encoding Paths (BUG CLASS -> #273)\nThe delimiter leakage fix required two commits because artifacts go through multiple encoding paths: HTML direct, base64-in-TeX, and hover JSON. A centralized sanitization point would prevent future recurrences. **Logged as #273.**\n\n### F4: Label Validation Gap Already Identified (ALREADY TRACKED)\nSession 4 hit label validation failure during batch issue creation. Already captured in L3 meta-summary and filed as #260.\n\n### F5: Mid-Conversation Architectural Pivots Are Productive But Costly (OBSERVATION)\nSession 4's scoping pivoted from original Wave 4-5 to Lake-first architecture when the user surfaced \"move Dress upstream.\" The pivot was correct (user praised it) but the discarded decomposition work is a non-trivial cost. No issue needed -- this is inherent to exploratory scoping.\n\n### F6: Threshold-Based Testing Pattern Worth Standardizing (#274)\nSession 1 used >= 1rem thresholds instead of exact values, making tests resilient to minor adjustments. This pattern should be documented and applied across visual tests. **Logged as #274.**\n\n## Issues Filed\n- #273: Audit and test artifact encoding paths to prevent syntax leakage\n- #274: Standardize threshold-based assertions for visual/layout tests\n\n## Issues Already Tracked\n- #244: SBS grid restructure (from Session 1)\n- #260: Label pre-validation (from Session 4, via L3)\n\n## Metrics\n- Sessions analyzed: 4\n- Findings: 6 (1 positive pattern, 2 observations, 1 already tracked, 2 actionable)\n- Issues created: 2 (#273, #274)\n- Issues already tracked: 2 (#244, #260)\n\n## Note\nThis is a retroactive L2 introspection. The 4x geometric decay pattern (L0 every task, L1 every 4, L2 every 16) was designed but never automated (#272). This batch covers the first 4 of 12 task sessions since Feb 5 22:19."
