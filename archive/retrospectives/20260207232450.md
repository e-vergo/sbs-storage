# Wave 1: MCP Bug Fixes (#277, #260)

## What was done
- Fixed DuckDB index not indexing entries after Jan 31 (#277): Root cause was mixed entry_id formats (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS vs Unix timestamps) breaking lexicographic string comparison. Fixed by switching all since-filtering and ordering to use `created_at` timestamps instead of `entry_id` strings. Applied across 9+ locations in duckdb_layer.py.
- Added label pre-validation to sbs_issue_create and sbs_issue_log (#260): New `_validate_labels()` function checks labels against GitHub repo labels (cached 5 min TTL), provides suggestions via difflib for invalid labels, fails fast instead of silently stripping.

## Test results
- 225/225 MCP tests passing (1 new test added for backwards compatibility of since parameter)

## Issues addressed
- #277: Archive DuckDB index not indexing entries after Jan 31
- #260: Add label pre-validation to sbs_issue_create MCP tool
