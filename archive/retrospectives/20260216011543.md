## Fix: Dress.Graph.Build Thunk compatibility for Lean 4.28.0-rc1

### What happened
OSforGFF CI failed on `Dress.Graph.Build` because `SimplePersistentEnvExtension.getState` now returns `Thunk σ` in Lean 4.28.0-rc1 (batteries change). The `fromEnvironment` function called `.toArray.toList` directly on the Thunk-wrapped result.

### Root cause
Commit `a0f0dca` ("revert fromEnvironment to use getState instead of getEntries") reintroduced a raw `getState` call, undoing the Thunk adaptation from `4be3454`. The earlier fix correctly used `getEntries` (a higher-level API that handles the Thunk internally).

### Fix applied
Changed `Dress/Graph/Build.lean:395` from `(Architect.blueprintExt.getState env).toArray.toList` to `Architect.blueprintExt.getEntries env`, restoring the approach from commit `4be3454`.

### Impact
- OSforGFF: directly unblocked
- GCR: currently on older Dress commit, passes, but would fail on update without this fix
- PNT/SBS-Test: same situation as GCR
- All repos on v4.28.0-rc1 lean-toolchain
