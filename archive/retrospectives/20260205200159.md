# Retrospective: GitHub Repo Name Alignment (Issue #231)

## What happened
VSCode GitHub Issues extension wasn't populating because the extension was querying `e-vergo/Side-By-Side-Blueprint` while the actual GitHub repo is `e-vergo/SLS-Strange-Loop-Station`. The repo was renamed at some point but references throughout the codebase weren't updated.

## What changed
Updated 21 files across the monorepo to reference `e-vergo/SLS-Strange-Loop-Station`:
- **VSCode settings** — Fixed the immediate user-facing issue (queries now target correct repo)
- **MCP server** — `GITHUB_REPO` constants in `sbs_tools.py` and `skill_tools.py`
- **Python CLI** — Default repo in `cli.py` and `labels/sync.py`
- **JSON schemas** — `$id` fields in 4 schema files
- **READMEs** — 9 files across toolchain/, showcase/, and forks/
- **Agent docs** — `sbs-developer.md` gh command examples
- **MCP test + README** — Test fixtures and documentation
- **Lean source** — `Runway/Paper.lean` link

## What was NOT changed
- Archive data (historical JSON entries) — immutable records
- Claude session data — historical
- Archived skill definitions — historical
- Local directory name (`Side-By-Side-Blueprint`) — user decided to keep as-is
- `CLAUDE.md` path references — still valid since directory wasn't renamed

## Scope
Closes #231 (VSCode extension now correctly queries the repo)
