# Task Retrospective: Register Dress + Runway for Self-Documentation

## What Was Done
Registered Dress and Runway as buildable SBS projects in the MCP tooling, enabling self-documentation dogfooding. Fixed a pre-existing bug where `sls_build_project` called a non-existent `build.py`.

## Changes
- **sls_tools.py**: Added Dress/Runway entries to all 8 project maps (validate, build, graph, serve, screenshot, visual_history, search, inspect). Fixed build command from `python build.py` to `lake build`.
- **cli.py**: Added Dress/Runway to `sls clean --project` choices.

## Verification
- `lake build DressBlueprint` succeeds (90 jobs)
- `lake exe extract_blueprint graph DressBlueprint` generates 311 nodes, 443 edges, 2160 subgraph SVGs
- `lake exe generate-blueprint-verso` generates Verso HTML
- Full `lake build` succeeds (230 jobs with all targets)
- Site serves and renders correctly (dashboard, dep graph, chapter pages)

## Key Finding
Both Dress (311 annotations) and Runway (304 annotations) already had complete self-documentation infrastructure. This task was purely registration/plumbing -- the hard annotation work was already done. The toolchain successfully documents itself.
