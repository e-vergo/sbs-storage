# Session Retrospective: 1770202274

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Epoch:** Current (29 entries)
**Context:** /task #168 -- Enable automated /qa -> /task -> /introspect loop for unattended QA convergence. Branch: `task/crush-10-issues`. PR #170 merged (squash).

## 1. User Orchestration

Clean, decisive session. The user answered all alignment questions immediately with minimal back-and-forth. Key interactions:

- **Architecture question** (new skill vs. autonomous flags): User selected "first 2" -- both options. This compound selection was unambiguous and covered the full design space.
- **Planning skip in auto mode**: User agreed that /converge does not need a planning phase since fix scope derives from QA ledger failures.
- **Max iterations**: User accepted 3 as the default with override.
- **Plan approval**: First presentation, no revisions requested.
- **Finalization approval**: Compressed confirmation, no additional review needed.

No friction points. No rejected proposals. The alignment phase was efficient and produced clear requirements.

## 2. Claude Alignment

Strong alignment throughout. The design questions were well-structured (GUI-style multiple choice per user preference) and captured the key architectural decisions. The execution matched the plan exactly -- 4 parallel agents writing to non-overlapping files, all completing successfully.

No corrections or redirections were needed. The single-wave parallel execution plan was appropriate for this task: four independent files with no cross-dependencies during writing.

Gate pass: 730/730 evergreen tests passed on first attempt. No retry cycles needed.

## 3. System Design

The /converge skill represents a well-scoped addition to the skill ecosystem:

- **Stateful substates** (`eval-N`, `fix-N`) encode iteration state in the substate name itself, making recovery after compaction straightforward.
- **No planning phase** is a deliberate design choice -- fix scope is mechanically derived from QA criterion failures, not from open-ended analysis.
- **Plateau detection** plus hard cap (3 iterations) provides two safety valves against infinite loops.
- **No user interaction during loop** makes it truly unattended while preserving the gate-failure pause as a safety valve.

The `/task --auto` mode addition was minimal (39 lines in SKILL.md) and correctly scoped: it skips AskUserQuestion calls but preserves all gates and validations.

Cross-skill integration in `/qa` SKILL.md properly documents the handoff path: /qa produces a ledger, /converge reads it.

## 4. Plan Execution

Single-wave, 4-agent plan executed perfectly:

| Agent | Target | Lines | Outcome |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| A1 | `.claude/skills/converge/SKILL.md` | 352 | New skill definition |
| A2 | `.claude/skills/task/SKILL.md` | +39 | --auto mode section |
| A3 | `.claude/skills/qa/SKILL.md` | +34 | Cross-skill integration |
| A4 | `CLAUDE.md` | +10 | /converge entry |

No file conflicts. No retry needed. All 4 agents completed successfully and changes were verified against the plan.

Issue #168 closed. PR #170 created and merged (squash strategy). Branch `task/crush-10-issues` remains (carries forward).

## 5. Meta-Observations

- **Session efficiency:** This was one of the cleanest /task executions. Alignment was decisive, planning was approved first-pass, execution had no failures, and finalization closed cleanly. This is the expected pattern for documentation-only / skill-definition work that doesn't touch Lean code or require builds.
- **Parallel agent utility:** 4 concurrent agents for 4 independent files is the ideal case for parallelism. Total wall-clock time was dominated by the single longest agent rather than sequential sum.
- **Skill design maturity:** The /converge skill was designed with full awareness of existing patterns (archive protocol, MCP lifecycle tools, recovery semantics). This suggests the skill ecosystem documentation is mature enough to enable coherent new skill creation.
- **No builds required:** This task only created/modified markdown skill definitions and documentation. No Lean compilation or site generation was needed. The evergreen test gate still ran and passed, confirming no regressions.
