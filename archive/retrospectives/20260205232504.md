# Session Retrospective: #230 Toggle Removal + SBS Alignment

## What Was Done
- Removed Lean column toggle (chevron + click-to-collapse) from plastex.js and common.css per #230
- Added declaration alignment via `padding-top: 1.5rem` on `.sbs-lean-column pre.lean-code` in blueprint.css
- Tightened proof content spacing: `.proof_content` margin-top reduced from 0.5rem to 0.25rem
- Wrote 8 evergreen tests in `test_sbs_alignment.py` with threshold-based validation (>= 1rem)
- Filed #244 for grid restructure to solve proof body alignment structurally

## Key Decisions
- Proof body alignment dropped from this session: fixed CSS margin can't solve content-dependent vertical gaps
- Declaration alignment uses 1.5rem (measured ~24px heading height) instead of initial 0.35rem guess
- Tests use `>= 1rem` threshold instead of exact value match, preventing future regressions from insufficient values

## Issues Closed
- #230: Remove toggle that shows/hides all Lean code from side-by-side view

## Issues Filed
- #244: Restructure SBS grid for natural declaration and proof body alignment
