# Wave 7: Documentation Batch (9 issues)

## What was done

### Agent 1: Developer Guide (#278, #275)
- #278: Added Lean Namespace Gotchas section to sbs-developer.md (double-namespacing, RPC name matching)
- #275: Added Dual Rendering Paths documentation with 8-item field addition checklist to sbs-developer.md

### Agent 2: Test/Validation Standards (#274, #273, #279)
- #274: Added Testing Conventions section to TEST_CATALOG.md (threshold vs exact assertions)
- #273: Audited all artifact encoding paths in Dress. Found 4 per-declaration paths, 4 TeX macro paths, legacy Output.lean path (no delimiter stripping — documented gap), serialize paths. Created 6 regression tests in test_delimiter_sanitization.py (all passing).
- #279: Documented fan-out synchronization points and defined synchronization completeness metric in TEST_CATALOG.md

### Agent 3: Process Documentation (#261, #263, #269)
- #261: Added explore-before-decompose pattern to CLAUDE.md
- #263: Documented AskUserQuestion effectiveness with real analytics data (715 questions across 140 sessions). Top headers: Scope (60), Approach (48), Confirm (39). Multi-select at 10.8%.
- #269: Added VSCode MCP tools table and usage guidance to CLAUDE.md

### Agent 4: #231 Investigation
- Found label query mismatch: VSCode queries filter on `label:bug`/`label:feature` but repo uses sub-labels (`bug:functional`, `feature:new`). Posted diagnostic comment on issue. Recommend keeping open until fixed.
