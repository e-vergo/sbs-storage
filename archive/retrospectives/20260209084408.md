# Session Retrospective: Blueprint Infoview Polish (#297, #298)

## Summary
Follow-up polish session for the Blueprint Dashboard feature in vscode-lean4. Three improvements shipped:

1. **LaTeX rendering fix** -- Above, Below, and Message fields in the Blueprint infoview panel were displaying raw `$...$` markup instead of rendered math. Routed all three through the existing `MathStatement`/KaTeX component.

2. **Serve / Build & Serve button split (#298)** -- Replaced the single "Open Dashboard" link with two distinct royal blue rounded buttons: "Serve" (opens existing build output instantly) and "Build & Serve" (runs full Lake pipeline first). Eliminates the dialog box interaction.

3. **New window/fullscreen attempt** -- Tried `workbench.action.moveActiveEditorToNewWindow` + `toggleFullScreen` to launch the dashboard in its own fullscreen window. The commands didn't fire reliably against webview panels. Removed the code cleanly. Logged as future exploration.

## Commits
- `bc6d0a49` -- fix: render LaTeX in Above, Below, and Message infoview fields
- `b08f6173` -- feat: split Open Dashboard into Serve / Build & Serve buttons

## Issues
- #297 (Blueprint Dashboard) -- continued polish
- #298 (Serve/Build split) -- logged and implemented in same session

## Lessons
- VSCode's `moveActiveEditorToNewWindow` command doesn't reliably target webview panels -- may need the `vscode.window` API with auxiliary windows (proposed API) instead.
- Hot-patching workflow is stable: build, copy 4 files, reload. Extension version changed from 0.0.200 to 0.0.222 between sessions.
