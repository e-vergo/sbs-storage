# Session Retrospective: /task Batch Issue Crush (10 Issues)

**Entry ID:** 1770180967
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Skill:** /task
**Issues:** #111, #114, #121, #122, #123, #124, #125, #126, #127, #129 (all closed), PR #132 (merged)
**Outcome:** 10/14 open issues closed (71% backlog reduction), 689/689 evergreen + 66/66 self-improve tests passing, 0 retries across 5 waves

## 1. User Orchestration

**Effective patterns:**
- Alignment was completed in exactly 3 AskUserQuestion prompts, each using the multiple-choice format. The user's responses were decisive: scoped to 10 issues (excluding 4 architectural), confirmed wave grouping strategy, and approved the plan on first attempt.
- During execution (5 waves, 7 agent invocations), zero user interruptions were needed. The wave-by-operation-type structure gave the user enough visibility to trust autonomous execution.
- Finalization was a single confirmation prompt. The user approved merge after reviewing the gate results (689 evergreen, 66 self-improve, all 10 issues closed).

**Areas for improvement:**
- None identified. This session's orchestration was the cleanest observed to date. The 3-question alignment pattern for batch operations should be codified.

**Observation for L2:** The triage-by-actionability structure (5 tiers from "immediately fixable" to "architectural redesign") was highly effective for batch scoping. The user only needed to confirm/reject tier boundaries rather than evaluate each issue individually. This compressed what could have been 10+ alignment questions into 3.

## 2. Claude Alignment

**What went right:**
- Tier classification was well-calibrated. The 4 excluded issues (#128 architectural, #120 rethink, #118 community engagement, #115 integration-scale) were correctly identified as requiring separate dedicated sessions.
- The decision to group Wave 2 issues (guidance prose: #127, #125, #124, #122) together was validated -- these were all SKILL.md/sbs-developer.md changes with similar edit patterns.
- Feature request #131 (`/task crush`) was logged during alignment with design notes informed by the actual triage experience, capturing institutional knowledge while it was fresh.

**What went right (serendipitous):**
- Wave 0 agent discovered and fixed 27 additional test failures beyond the 3 targeted. The pydantic import shim (`test_self_improve.py`) was not in any issue but was blocking the test suite. This was correctly identified and fixed without scope creep -- it was a prerequisite for the gate to pass.

**Assumption errors:**
- None that required correction during execution. The pre-execution exploration phase (3 parallel agents) gathered sufficient context to write accurate plans.

## 3. System Design

**Tooling that worked well:**
- The 5-wave structure (sequential except Waves 2 and 4 which ran parallel) was the right decomposition. Wave ordering respected the dependency chain: datetime fixes first (Wave 0) because they affected test infrastructure, then module caching (Wave 1) because validators depend on it, then guidance prose (Wave 2) and tagger logic (Wave 3) as independent concerns, then hardening (Wave 4) as a cross-cutting concern.
- The `sbs_issue_log` tool was used effectively to log #131 during alignment -- zero friction, auto-populated archive context.
- Gate mechanism worked perfectly: 689/689 evergreen + 66/66 self-improve tests at finalization.

**Tooling friction:**
- No meaningful friction. The MCP tools, archive system, and test infrastructure all functioned as expected.

**Patterns validated:**
- Wave grouping by operation type (from #127 guidance) was validated by this session. Grouping similar file-edit patterns together (e.g., all guidance prose in one wave) reduces context-switching overhead for agents.
- Parallel agents for non-overlapping files (Wave 2: 2 agents on different files, Wave 4: 2 agents on different files) worked without collisions.

## 4. Plan Execution

**Plan adherence:** The approved plan was executed exactly as written. All 5 waves completed in order, all 7 agent invocations succeeded on first attempt, zero mid-flight adjustments were needed.

**What was well-estimated:**
- Wave complexity was accurately gauged. No wave took significantly longer than expected.
- The decision to run Wave 0 first (datetime + pydantic fixes) was critical -- these fixes unblocked the test gate that all subsequent waves depended on.
- Parallel waves (2 and 4) correctly identified non-overlapping file targets.

**What was underestimated:**
- Nothing. This is the first /task session with zero retries and zero plan amendments.

**Agent efficiency:**
- 7 agent invocations for 10 issues = 1.43 issues/agent on average. Wave 2 was most efficient (4 issues / 2 agents). Wave 0 had the highest serendipitous value (3 targeted fixes + 27 bonus test fixes).

## 5. Meta-Observations

**This session as /task crush prototype:**
- The triage pattern (load issues, classify by actionability tier, scope via user confirmation, group into waves by operation type) is exactly the workflow that #131 proposes to formalize.
- Key parameters discovered empirically: 10 issues is manageable in a single session, 5 waves is a comfortable maximum, 3 alignment questions suffice for batch scoping.
- The tier structure should be codified: Tier 1 (quick fixes), Tier 2 (moderate with clear scope), Tier 3 (requires exploration), Tier 4 (requires design), Tier 5 (architectural/external).

**Archive system observations:**
- 29 entries in this epoch, consistent with the session complexity (10 issues, 5 waves, multiple archive transitions).
- PR workflow (create at plan approval, merge at finalization) worked smoothly for PR #132.

**Backlog health:**
- Reduced from 14 to 4 open issues. The remaining 4 are all architectural/design issues that require dedicated sessions.
- Issue quality improved: the remaining issues (#128, #120, #118, #115) are well-defined with clear scope, having been reviewed during triage.

**Pattern for L2 synthesis:**
- Zero-retry execution across 5 waves suggests the exploration-then-plan pattern (3 parallel exploration agents before planning) provides sufficient context to avoid mid-flight corrections. This pattern should be standard for multi-issue tasks.
- The 3-question alignment pattern (scope, grouping, confirmation) is sufficient for batch operations when the issue backlog is well-structured with clear labels and descriptions.

## Key Findings (for archive entry notes)

1. 10/14 issues closed in single session with zero retries across 5 execution waves -- cleanest /task execution to date
2. Wave-by-operation-type grouping (from #127) validated: similar edit patterns grouped together reduce agent context-switching
3. Serendipitous value: Wave 0 agent fixed 27 additional test failures beyond 3 targeted (pydantic import shim)
4. Triage-by-actionability (5 tiers) compressed alignment to 3 questions -- prototype pattern for /task crush (#131)
5. Backlog reduced from 14 to 4 issues; remaining 4 are architectural requiring dedicated sessions
