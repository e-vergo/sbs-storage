# Wave 6: Introspection Hierarchy (#272)

## What was done
Full implementation of the geometric 4x decay introspection hierarchy from the parallel-orbiting-pinwheel plan.

### MCP Layer (Sub-Wave 6A)
- Added SelfImproveContext model to sbs_models.py
- Added compute_self_improve_level(multiplier=4) to duckdb_layer.py — walks up level hierarchy counting level:LN tagged entries
- Added get_self_improve_findings(level) and get_improvement_captures() to duckdb_layer.py
- Added sbs_self_improve() MCP tool to skill_tools.py — assembles full context blob with level, transcript, findings, issues, captures

### Agent Definition (Sub-Wave 6B)
- Created .claude/agents/sbs-self-improve.md — full autonomous agent with L0/L1/L2+ workflows
- Created dev/storage/archive/self-improve/ directory for finding documents

### Documentation (Sub-Wave 6C)
- CLAUDE.md: added Post-Task Self-Improvement section, sbs_self_improve tool docs, tools table row
- SLS_EXTENSION.md: added Self-Improvement Agent section with VSCode integration notes
- Archive_Orchestration_and_Agent_Harmony.md: added sbs-self-improve to agent roster

## Test results
- 225/225 MCP tests passing

## Issues addressed
- #272: Introspection hierarchy (4x geometric decay) designed but never implemented — FULLY IMPLEMENTED
