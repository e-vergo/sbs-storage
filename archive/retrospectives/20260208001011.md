# Wave 4: MCP Features (#243, #262, #276)

## What was done
- #243: Added auto-run T5/T6 validators in visual verification gate. New functions _detect_visual_changes() and _run_visual_validators() in skill_tools.py. Runs during task finalization when visual file changes detected. Soft gate — warns but doesn't block.
- #262: Added L3 findings auto-create GitHub issues. New functions _parse_l3_findings(), _deduplicate_against_open_issues(), _create_l3_issues() in skill_tools.py. Max 5 issues per L3 cycle with dedup. Creates epic when 2+ issues. Applied in L3+ archive phase.
- #276: Added block-wait enforcement documentation to CLAUDE.md and sbs-developer.md. Convention-only — NEVER use run_in_background=true for sbs-developer agents.

## Test results
- 225/225 MCP tests passing

## Issues addressed
- #243: Auto-run T5/T6 validators in visual verification gate
- #262: Standardize L3 findings → GitHub issues as default behavior
- #276: Enforce block-wait pattern for agent spawning
