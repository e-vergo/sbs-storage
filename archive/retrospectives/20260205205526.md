# L4 Meta-Introspection: Close the Observation-Action Gap

## Session Summary

Executed all 9 child issues of #241 in a single `/task` invocation across 3 waves of concurrent `sbs-developer` agents (10 agents total). Every issue was implemented, tested, and closed.

## Metrics

- **Issues closed:** 9/9 child issues + parent #241
- **Agents spawned:** 10 (4 + 4 + 2)
- **Tests:** 715/719 evergreen (4 pre-existing), 239/239 MCP
- **Archive entries retagged:** 977/977 (100%)
- **Files modified:** ~20 across 2 repos (dev/scripts, forks/sbs-lsp-mcp)
- **Follow-up issue filed:** #243 (auto-run T5/T6 in visual verification gate)

## Wave Results

**Wave 0 (Investigation + Quick Wins):**
- #238: Found critical `phase_fail` → CLI rejection bug, 9 defensive finalization fixes
- #240: USER_PROFILE.md ref already existed in CLAUDE.md
- #233: Header taxonomy reduced from 10 to 6 based on 662 interactions
- #237: Fixed 4-time-failing tag pipeline — root cause was `upload.py` never passing `session_context`

**Wave 1 (Core Pipeline):**
- #232: Improvement captures now visible in L2 discovery + new `sbs_improvement_review` tool
- #235: MCP tool calls tracked in archive, oracle-first compliance hook added
- #236: Visual verification soft gate added to task finalization
- #234: Adaptive retrospectives — friction detection selects compressed vs full template

**Wave 2 (Capstone):**
- #239: Verification rate replaces closure rate as primary L2 metric
- Retroactive retagging: All 977 entries cleaned — session-constant noise eliminated, entry-scoped tags now discriminative (mean 6.4 tags/entry, down from 20-30+)

## Key Discovery

The tag signal pipeline (#237) had been closed 4 times previously (#110, #121, #138, #160) without verification — each fix missed the root cause. This session found it: `upload.py` called tagger with a single merged context, never using the split context system. This is exactly the pattern #239's verification rate metric is designed to catch going forward.
