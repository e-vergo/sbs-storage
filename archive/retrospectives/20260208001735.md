# Wave 5: Test Suite + CI (#264, #242)

## What was done
- #264: Audited test suite against crush changes. No obsolete BLUEPRINT_DRESS references found. All 887 tests already properly marked (810 evergreen, 71 dev, 6 interactive). Updated VSCODE_EXT_SPEC.md with crush completion status: all 3 crush sessions marked complete, per-issue status columns added, deferred items noted (watch mode, dev server), track statuses updated.
- #242: Optimized graph cache key in dress-blueprint-action/action.yml from github.sha (invalidated every commit) to content-addressed hash of Lean sources + lakefile. Added cache strategy documentation block. Toolchain and Lake caches were already optimized.

## Test results
- 795/795 evergreen tests passing (identical before and after)

## Issues addressed
- #264: Post-crush test suite update and convergence pass
- #242: Implement full CI cache strategy in dress-blueprint-action
