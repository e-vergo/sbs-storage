# Task Retrospective: Extend Declaration Type Support (#342)

## What Was Done
Made structure, class, instance, and abbrev first-class citizens in the Dress toolchain's coverage tracking and classification system.

## Changes (3 files, 2 repos)
- **LeanArchitect/Attribute.lean**: `mkStatementPart` auto-detects `latexEnv` from Environment metadata
- **Dress/Graph/Build.lean**: `constantKind` extended with env/name params; `fromEnvironment` auto-overrides latexEnv; `computeCoverage` passes context
- **Dress/Generate/Latex.lean**: `getDefaultLatexEnv` returns specific environment types

## Key Decisions
- Used `ReducibilityHints.isAbbrev` (kernel-level) over `getReducibilityStatusCore` for detecting abbreviations
- Classification order: most-specific-first (isClass before isStructure, isInstanceCore before isAbbrev)
- Existing filters sufficient -- no changes needed

## Verification
- SBS-Test: clean build (3150 jobs), zero new diagnostics, 0 test failures

## What This Enables
Self-documentation of Dress and Runway via blueprint coverage tracking.
