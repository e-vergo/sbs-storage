# Session Retrospective: 1770200701

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Epoch:** Current (29 entries since epoch 1770200464)
**Context:** Standalone /update-and-archive invocation on branch `task/crush-10-issues`

---

## 1. User Orchestration

This epoch is unusual -- it consists almost entirely of retroactive migration entries (28 of 29) from January 31, with tags `retroactive` and one entry tagged `release, v1`. The actual development work on the `task/crush-10-issues` branch (7 feature/fix commits closing issues #99, #149, #160, #161, #162, #163, #164, #166, #167) was committed but never closed with a proper /update-and-archive cycle.

**Observation:** The branch name `task/crush-10-issues` implies a batch issue-crushing session. The commits show focused, well-scoped work: taxonomy unification (#99), skill refactoring (#166, #167), MCP tool improvements (#163), tagger fixes (#160), and documentation (#149, #161, #162). This represents productive multi-issue work that was never formally archived.

## 2. Claude Alignment

Limited data available for this dimension since this is a standalone invocation without a rich task session. The archive state shows `global_state` was stuck at `{skill: "update-and-archive", substate: "execution"}` -- a non-standard substate for u&a that likely leaked from a previous /task session's execution phase. This state staleness prevented clean epoch boundaries.

**Key issue:** The state machine had a stale global_state that was never properly cleaned up. The 3 most recent commits are all "chore: archive upload" suggesting repeated attempts to manage state.

## 3. System Design

- **State recovery:** The stale `execution` substate on the u&a skill demonstrates the importance of the `sbs_skill_fail` / `sbs_skill_end` mechanisms for cleanup. When a session ends without proper skill termination, the state persists indefinitely.
- **Retroactive migration:** 28 retroactive entries suggest a bulk data migration was performed (likely importing historical screenshot data into the archive system). This is useful historical data but inflates epoch entry counts.
- **No builds in epoch:** Zero build triggers in this entire epoch. All 29 entries are manual or skill-triggered. This is consistent with a documentation/tooling-focused session.

## 4. Plan Execution

The `task/crush-10-issues` branch successfully delivered work against at least 10 issues:
- **#99**: Unified label and archive taxonomies
- **#149**: Loop opportunities catalog
- **#160**: Tagger context builder split
- **#161, #162**: CLI gotchas and testing standards
- **#163**: MCP repo parameter for sbs_run_tests
- **#164**: Verification sampling for L2 discovery
- **#166**: Self-improve absorbed into introspect
- **#167**: Embedded data replaced with source references

All commits are ahead of main (14 commits). The branch has not been merged.

## 5. Meta-Observations

- **Epoch hygiene:** This epoch spans from Jan 31 to Feb 4 (4+ days) without closure. Long epochs reduce the value of epoch-level aggregation. The u&a skill should ideally run at the end of each work session.
- **State machine gap:** There is no automated cleanup for stale global_state. If a session crashes or the user closes their terminal mid-skill, the state remains set until manually cleared or overridden by the next invocation.
- **Branch-to-main gap:** 14 commits ahead of main with no PR or merge. This standalone u&a should clean this up by at least ensuring porcelain state.
- **Archive data quality:** The retroactive migration entries have minimal metadata (just "Retroactive migration" notes). While they preserve screenshot history, they lack the session data and quality scores that normal archive entries contain.
