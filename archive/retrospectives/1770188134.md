# Retrospective: Task Crush #138 #136 #139 #140 #137 #147 #141

**Entry ID:** 1770188134
**Skill:** /task (crush mode)
**Issues resolved:** #136, #137, #138, #139, #140, #141, #147
**Issues deferred:** #99, #142, #143, #146, #148, #149

## 1. User Orchestration

**Efficiency: High.** The user invoked `/task crush` with a well-defined scope (open issues). The alignment phase was a single triage proposal followed by a single confirmation -- no back-and-forth needed. The user approved the plan on first presentation, indicating the triage categorization (close-now vs defer) matched expectations.

**Observation:** The crush format works well for housekeeping backlogs. The user's decision to defer 6 issues was immediate, suggesting clear internal prioritization. No doing-mode signals were present throughout.

## 2. Claude Alignment

**Accuracy: High.** The triage split (7 actionable / 6 deferred) was accepted without modification. Issue categorization was correct -- #138 (auto-tagger deferral) was correctly identified as closeable by decision rather than code, while #147 (zebra striping) and #141 (self-improve entry search) required actual implementation.

**Wave decomposition was sound:** Separating docs (Wave 1) from code (Wave 2) prevented file collisions and allowed parallel execution within each wave. Wave 0 (closing #138 directly) was correctly identified as requiring no agent.

**No corrections or redirections occurred during the session.**

## 3. System Design

**Build pipeline:** All 689 evergreen tests passed with 0 failures across the session. No gate failures, no retries needed. The PR workflow (create -> merge) executed cleanly via `sbs_pr_create` and `sbs_pr_merge`.

**Parallel agent execution:** 4 agents ran across 2 waves (2 per wave) without file collisions. The file-scope partitioning (SKILL.md vs sbs-developer.md in Wave 1; blueprint.css vs sbs_self_improve.py in Wave 2) was clean.

**Observation:** The crush mode pattern (triage -> waves -> PR -> merge) is now well-established. The only manual step was the initial triage decision.

## 4. Plan Execution

**Adherence: Complete.** All 7 issues resolved as planned:
- Wave 0: #138 closed directly (policy decision, no code)
- Wave 1: #136, #139, #140 (SKILL.md updates), #137 (sbs-developer.md update) -- both agents completed successfully
- Wave 2: #147 (CSS zebra striping added), #141 (self-improve entry search fixed) -- both agents completed successfully

**PR #151** created and merged via squash strategy. No merge conflicts.

**Timing:** The session was efficient -- exploration phase used 4 parallel read-only agents to gather context, then 3 execution waves ran without blocking.

## 5. Meta-Observations

- **Crush mode maturity:** This is now a reliable pattern for batch issue resolution. The triage -> categorize -> wave-execute -> merge flow is predictable and efficient.
- **Deferred issue quality:** The 6 deferred issues (#99, #142, #143, #146, #148, #149) represent genuinely larger work items that would not benefit from crush treatment. Good triage discipline.
- **Documentation-first wave ordering:** Putting docs before code in wave ordering is a good default -- docs changes are lower risk and establish context for code changes.
- **No friction points identified in this session.** The workflow executed as designed.
