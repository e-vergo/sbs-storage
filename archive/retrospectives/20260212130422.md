# Session Retrospective: Zebra Striping Removal (#307)

## Task
Fix inconsistent backgrounds in side-by-side proof displays on blueprint pages.

## Root Cause
Zebra striping in `blueprint.css` alternated `.sbs-container` backgrounds on even-numbered theorem sections, but `.sbs-proof-lean pre.lean-code` had an explicit `background-color: var(--sbs-bg-surface)` override. The left panel (LaTeX) inherited the zebra color while the right panel (Lean) was forced to the base surface color, creating a visible mismatch on every even-numbered block.

## Changes
- **dress-blueprint-action** (`22826a3`): Removed zebra striping CSS rule, `--sbs-zebra-even` variables (light + dark), the `background-color` override on `pre.lean-code`, and all zebra references in comments and README
- **Side-By-Side-Blueprint** (`b05f5cf`): Submodule pointer update
- **SLS** (`f72d622`): Submodule pointer updates (SBS + storage)
- **sbs-storage**: QA screenshots and archive index committed

## Outcome
All theorem blocks now display with uniform `--sbs-bg-surface` background across both panels. Issue #307 logged and closed.

## Process Notes
- Investigation via Explore agent identified root cause quickly (CSS specificity conflict between zebra and code cell override)
- User confirmed simplest fix (remove zebra entirely) rather than attempting to make zebra work correctly
- Build MCP tool returned success=false; worked around by copying CSS directly into build output for verification
