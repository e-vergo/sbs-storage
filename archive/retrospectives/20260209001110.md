# Issue #297: Blueprint Dashboard Button in VSCode Infoview

## What was done

Implemented a full "Open Dashboard" feature for the vscode-lean4 extension on the `sbs/blueprint-panel` branch. The feature allows users to trigger the SBS build pipeline and view the generated blueprint site directly within a VSCode webview tab.

### Files created
- `vscode-lean4/src/blueprintBuild.ts` -- 3-step Lake build pipeline (build, :depGraph, runway) with dynamic Runway executable discovery, cancellation support, and progress notifications
- `vscode-lean4/src/blueprintDashboard.ts` -- WebviewPanel manager with HTML transformation (asset URI rewriting, CSP injection, navigation interceptor), page navigation, rebuild toolbar, fragment scrolling, PDF link handling, and error pages

### Files modified
- `vscode-lean4/src/extension.ts` -- Instantiates BlueprintDashboardProvider
- `vscode-lean4/package.json` -- Registers `lean4.blueprint.openDashboard` command with command palette entry
- `lean4-infoview/src/infoview/blueprintPanel.tsx` -- "Open Dashboard" link via command: URI
- `lean4-infoview/src/infoview/index.css` -- Dashboard link styles

## Key design decisions
- **command: URI** for the infoview button (no EditorApi changes needed)
- **CDN allowed** via permissive CSP (MathJax, jQuery, Tippy.js)
- **Dynamic Runway discovery** -- walks up directory tree to find the Runway binary, handles both Lake dependency and SBS repo layouts
- **`:depGraph` facet** replaces the manual `+:blueprint` + `extract_blueprint graph` steps, fixing Lake v5 compatibility
- **No SLS/Python dependency** -- everything runs through Lake, community-facing

## Issues discovered during testing
1. `lake build +:blueprint` syntax is invalid in Lake v5 -- correct syntax is `lake build :blueprint` or `lake build :depGraph`
2. Runway is not a transitive dependency of consumer projects -- `lake exe runway` fails. Fixed with directory-walking discovery that finds the Runway binary in sibling/ancestor packages
3. Hot-patching the installed VSCode extension works for testing but requires copying all 4 files (extension.js, index.production.min.js, index.css, package.json) and a full VSCode restart

## Tested with
- SBS-Test (from-scratch build, all 3 steps succeed)
- GCR (from-scratch build with Runway discovery via ancestor walk)
- PNT (opened in infoview, dashboard link visible)
