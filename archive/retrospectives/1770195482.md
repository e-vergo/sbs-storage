# Retrospective: /task #159 -- /introspect Skill Creation

**Entry ID:** 1770195482
**Skill:** /task
**Issue resolved:** #159
**PR merged:** #165

## 1. User Orchestration

**Efficiency: High.** Three AskUserQuestion interactions during alignment, all productive:

1. **Approach selection:** User chose "New skill (/meta-improve)" from 4 options. Clear preference for a standalone skill rather than extending /self-improve.
2. **Output path:** User chose `dev/storage/archive/meta-summaries/` over alternatives. Straightforward decision.
3. **Scope:** User chose "Skill + first execution" -- implementing the skill definition and running it to produce the first L3 document in a single task.

**User redirect on naming:** The user corrected the skill name from "/meta-improve" to "/introspect" and specified it should be registered in CLAUDE.md's Custom Skills section. This is a clean example of alignment phase value -- the user had a specific name in mind that wasn't captured by the initial proposal.

**All focus areas selected:** When asked which analysis dimensions to include in the L3 document, the user selected all three (data-driven synthesis, recurring friction inventory, skill evolution trajectory). This matched the comprehensive approach the L3 document ultimately took.

**Pattern:** The alignment phase was efficient -- 3 questions, no wasted rounds, each question narrowed scope meaningfully. The user's corrections (naming, registration location) were minor adjustments that would have been harder to fix post-implementation.

## 2. Claude Alignment

**Accuracy: High.** Plan was approved without modification. All 3 waves executed as designed.

**Specific successes:**
- Wave structure correctly separated infrastructure (Wave 0), parallel document creation (Wave 1), and the L3 analysis that depended on the skill existing (Wave 2)
- Parallel agents in Wave 1 had cleanly non-overlapping files: Agent A wrote the new SKILL.md, Agent B updated existing docs (CLAUDE.md and self-improve/SKILL.md)
- Wave 2 agent successfully read all 5 L2 summaries and synthesized a substantive L3 document

**No misalignment observed.** The task was well-scoped (document creation, no code changes, no visual work) which reduced the surface area for errors. The only deviation was the user's naming correction, which happened during alignment before any implementation.

**L3 document quality:** The produced L3 meta-analysis (`L3-1770195056.md`) identified a central paradox (closure rates improving while verification rates drop to zero) and provided quantitative evidence across all 5 L2 summaries. The "Data Speaks" section with full issue tracking across 30 issues is a genuine analytical contribution, not just aggregation.

## 3. System Design

**Build pipeline health:** All gates passed cleanly:
- 709/709 evergreen tests (0 failures)
- No visual changes to validate (document-only task)

**PR workflow:** PR #165 created at plan approval, merged via squash at finalization. Clean execution.

**Parallel execution:** Wave 1 ran 2 agents in parallel without file collisions. The wave structure was simpler than typical feature tasks because all outputs were markdown files with no compile dependencies.

**No infrastructure issues.** No build required (document-only changes). No git conflicts. No tool failures.

## 4. Plan Execution

**Adherence: Complete.** All 3 waves executed exactly as planned with no deviations.

**Deliverables matched plan:**
- Wave 0: `dev/storage/archive/meta-summaries/.gitkeep` created
- Wave 1a: `.claude/skills/introspect/SKILL.md` written with full skill definition
- Wave 1b: CLAUDE.md updated with /introspect registration; self-improve/SKILL.md updated with Introspection Hierarchy table
- Wave 2: `dev/storage/archive/meta-summaries/L3-1770195056.md` written (366 lines of analysis)

**Files changed:** 4 files created/modified. Small, focused changeset for a skill creation task.

**Zero retries, zero gate failures.** This is the cleanest execution observed for a /task session -- no blocked agents, no mid-flight adjustments, no error recovery needed.

## 5. Meta-Observations

- **Document-only tasks have lowest execution risk.** No compilation, no visual changes, no cross-repo dependencies. The entire risk surface was limited to "write correct markdown." This explains the zero-retry execution.

- **The L3 analysis is genuinely useful.** The document identified that the self-improvement system has optimized for closure throughput (100% in recent cycles) while verification rates dropped to 0%. This is the kind of cross-cycle pattern that individual L1/L2 documents cannot surface because they lack the temporal span.

- **The /introspect skill fills a real gap.** Previously, L3 analysis happened ad-hoc within /task sessions. Having a dedicated skill with a defined workflow (read L2s, synthesize, write L3) makes the process repeatable and the outputs findable.

- **Alignment phase naming corrections justify the Q&A cost.** The user's redirect from "/meta-improve" to "/introspect" was a 2-second correction during alignment that would have required renaming files, updating registrations, and rewriting references if caught post-implementation. This is a concrete example of alignment ROI.

- **Session simplicity is not a weakness.** This session had no compilation errors, no visual work, no debugging. The temptation is to characterize this as "easy" and therefore less informative. But the clean execution demonstrates that when scope is well-defined and the task type (document creation) matches the wave structure, the system operates at its theoretical best. The interesting question is whether this reliability transfers to more complex tasks.
