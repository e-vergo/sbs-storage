# Task 223 Retrospective: Reductive Groups Showcase Scaffolding

## Objective
Create a new showcase repository demonstrating the path from mathlib foundations to "connected reductive group over a field" following Brian Conrad's definition.

## What Was Accomplished

### Repository Structure
Created `showcase/ReductiveGroups/` with full SBS infrastructure:
- Lake project with mathlib v4.27.0, Dress, verso dependencies
- GitHub Actions CI/CD for blueprint deployment
- LaTeX sources (blueprint.tex, paper.tex) with mathematical exposition

### Definition Hierarchy (45+ nodes)

**Foundation Layer (9 nodes):**
- `AffineGroupScheme` - core structure
- Hopf algebra approach (`coordinateHopfAlgebra`, morphism correspondence)
- Scheme approach (`functorOfPoints`, `groupObjectStructure`, Hopf-scheme equivalence)

**Unipotent Layer (11 nodes):**
- `IsSmooth`, Cartier's theorem, perfect field smoothness
- `IsUnipotentElement`, `IsUnipotentSubgroup`, composition series
- `unipotentRadical` (key declaration), existence/uniqueness
- Base change to algebraic closure

**Reductive Layer (10 nodes):**
- `IsReductive` (key declaration): G is k-smooth and R_u(G_{k̄}) = 1
- Alternative characterizations (representation-theoretic, radical/center)
- Examples: GL_n, SL_n, SO_n, Sp_{2n} (GL_n and SL_n as key declarations)

**Structure Theory (15 nodes):**
- Tori: `Gm`, `IsTorus`, `IsSplitTorus`, character/cocharacter groups
- Borel subgroups: existence, conjugacy
- Root systems: roots, positive roots, simple roots, Weyl group
- Split/quasi-split distinction, classification theorem

### Build Verification
- All 14 module files compile successfully
- Expected `sorry` warnings (structure over proofs, as aligned)
- Import fixes applied during build validation (mathlib API paths)

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Dual approach:** Scaffolded both Hopf algebra and scheme paths per user alignment
2. **Sorry-first:** Focused on dependency graph clarity over proof completion
3. **mathlib v4.27.0:** Matched existing showcase projects for consistency
4. **Key declarations:** Marked `IsReductive`, `unipotentRadical`, `gl_isReductive`, `sl_isReductive`, Cartier's theorem

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

1. **Import paths:** Several mathlib imports had incorrect paths:
   - `GrpObj.Basic` → `Monoidal.Cartesian.Grp_`
   - `HopfAlgebra` → `HopfAlgebra.Basic`
   - `CoalgebraCat` → `CoalgCat`
   - `AlgebraicClosure` → `IsAlgClosed.AlgebraicClosure`
   - `IsPerfectField` → `PerfectField`

2. **Universe issues:** `baseField` definition needed type inference fix
3. **Computability:** `toAlgClosure` needed `noncomputable` marker
4. **Parameter scoping:** `GLScheme`/`SLScheme` didn't use `n` parameter

## Next Steps (Future Sessions)
- Run full build.py to generate dependency graph and dashboard
- Verify dashboard displays key declarations correctly
- Consider adding more examples or structure theory detail
- Connect to Kevin Buzzard's specific interests from sloplib thread

## Session Metrics
- Waves executed: 4
- Parallel agents used: Up to 4 concurrent (Wave 2)
- Build iterations: 5 (fixes for import/type errors)
- Total blueprint nodes: ~45
