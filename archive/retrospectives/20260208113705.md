# Overnight Execution: 23 Issues Across 7 Waves + KaTeX Debugging

## Summary
Executed a pre-aligned overnight plan tackling 23 of 27 open issues across 7 waves, each via /task skill. Reduced open issues from 27 to 6 (now 7 with new #280).

## Wave Results
- Wave 1: Fixed DuckDB index (#277) and label pre-validation (#260) — 225/225 MCP tests
- Wave 2: Confirmed RPC status derivation (#268) and KaTeX bundle (#267/#271) already fixed
- Wave 3: Coordinated Dress+SubVerso update for GCR and PNT (#270) — both builds successful
- Wave 4: Auto T5/T6 validators (#243), L3 auto-issue creation (#262), block-wait docs (#276)
- Wave 5: Post-crush test suite audit (#264), CI cache optimization (#242)
- Wave 6: Full introspection hierarchy implementation (#272) — SelfImproveContext model, compute_self_improve_level, sbs-self-improve agent
- Wave 7: 9 documentation/process issues (#278, #274, #273, #275, #279, #261, #263, #269, #231)

## Post-Overnight: KaTeX Debugging
- Created PolynomialDemo.lean in SBS-Test with 3 polynomial factoring theorems
- Added debug instrumentation to MathStatement component (console.warn + visible output)
- Rebuilt and installed extension bundle
- KaTeX confirmed working after VSCode window reload
- Discovered partial rendering bug with \begin{equation} blocks in PNT — filed #280
