# Session Retrospective: Dress Self-Documentation Dogfooding

## What Was Done
Two tasks completed in one session, enabling the SBS toolchain to document itself.

### Task 1: Declaration Type Support (#342)
Extended Dress coverage tracking to classify structure, class, instance, and abbrev as first-class types instead of generic "inductive"/"def". Changed 3 files across LeanArchitect and Dress.

### Task 2: Build Infrastructure Registration
Registered Dress and Runway as buildable SBS projects in sls_tools.py (8 tool maps). Fixed pre-existing bug where sls_build_project called non-existent build.py (now uses `lake build`).

### Bug Fix: Type Priority in LeanArchitect
Discovered during verification that structures with `proof` description blocks were misclassified as "theorem" because `hasProof` was checked before declaration type. Fixed by reordering: check isClass/isStructure/isInstance/isAbbrev first, fall back to hasProof only for generic defnInfo.

## Verification
Dress self-documentation site generated successfully:
- 311 nodes, 443 edges, 2160 subgraph SVGs
- Correct type distribution: 262 definitions, 29 structures, 14 theorems, 14 instances, 4 classes, 2 abbrevs
- FAQ page present
- Site renders correctly with proper classification

## Key Insight
The hard work (311 retroactive @[blueprint] annotations, blueprint.tex, runway.json) was already done. This session was about closing the last mile: correct type classification + build infrastructure registration.
