## Session: SLS/SBS Split Finalization + Self-Improvement Catchup

### Completed
1. **Self-improvement geometric catchup (L0→L1→L2)**:
   - L0: 48 entries analyzed, build failure rate 31%, capture density 0.42/entry as friction metric
   - L1: Synthesized 2 L0 findings, identified 5 cross-session patterns, logged #287-#290
   - L2: Meta-analysis found strong convergence, 3 root causes (#284, #285, #287), highest-leverage fix is documentation-to-enforcement pipeline (#292). Logged #291-#295.
   - Total: 12 new issues (#284-#295), 5 finding documents in dev/storage/archive/self-improve/

2. **Side-By-Side-Blueprint cleanup**:
   - Removed `dev/storage/` from SBS index (515 files of SLS archive data tracked by mistake)
   - Registered `showcase/ReductiveGroups` as proper submodule
   - SBS now clean: 4 forks, 4 toolchain, 3 showcase, no SLS infrastructure

3. **Submodule path migration (SBS/ → Side-By-Side-Blueprint/)**:
   - Updated .gitmodules, .mcp.json SBS_ROOT, sls_utils.py fallback path
   - Updated all CLAUDE.md path references
   - Updated chat_archive.py path shortening in both sbs/ and sls/ copies
   - Verified skill_tools.py uses SBS_ROOT variable (no hardcoded paths)

### IO Captured
- Self-improve infrastructure should be fully MCP-self-contained (#1770595605)
