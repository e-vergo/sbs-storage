# Wave 3: Showcase Project Update (#270)

## What was done
- Successfully updated GCR's lake-manifest.json: SubVerso 550d0a89→160bb35d, verso 61178cc8→d95ac7c3, MD4Lean 38ac5945→7e097e9a
- GCR build succeeded (210.6s, 2649 jobs, 61 nodes, 73 edges)
- PNT already had correct versions — build succeeded (733.6s, 3646 jobs, 527 nodes, 954 edges)
- All three projects (SBS-Test, GCR, PNT) now aligned on Dress fd18878, SubVerso 160bb35d, LeanArchitect 4f8cbdf, mathlib v4.27.0
- Root cause of previous failure: GCR had old SubVerso 550d0a89 which was incompatible with new Dress API
