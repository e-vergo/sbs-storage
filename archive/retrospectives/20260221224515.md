Session: CLAUDE.md condensation + archive sync

Objective: Significantly reduce CLAUDE.md length while preserving critical operational guidance.

Approach:
- Remove verbose tool tables (MCP already documents these)
- Condense User Preferences to core principles
- Eliminate duplicate repository maps
- Shorten workflow descriptions
- Keep: orchestration model, essential paths, critical rules

Target: ~50% reduction (876 lines -> ~400 lines)
