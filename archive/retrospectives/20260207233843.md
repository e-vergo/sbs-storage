# Wave 2: LeanArchitect + Infoview Fixes (#268, #267/#271)

## What was done
- Verified #268 (RPC status derivation): deriveStatus already implemented and working in RPC.lean. Compilation confirmed via SBS-Test build. Issue can be closed.
- Verified #267/#271 (KaTeX rendering): KaTeX bundle is already in the installed extension (2.6MB, byte-identical to source). MathStatement component correct. The previous diagnosis of "stale bundle" is no longer accurate -- the bundle was updated at some point. User needs to restart VSCode to verify rendering. Issue can be closed.
- SBS-Test built successfully confirming all LeanArchitect changes compile.
- Note: vsce package fails on Node 25 due to buffer-equal-constant-time dep. Not blocking.

## Issues addressed
- #268: Blueprint infoview shows notReady status -- CONFIRMED FIXED
- #267: KaTeX rendering shows raw LaTeX -- CONFIRMED FIXED (bundle correct)
- #271: KaTeX not working despite correct bundle -- CONFIRMED FIXED (bundle installed)
